Evaluate these scale features carefully and for each feature, give a score from 1 to 5 for each feature, 
and in each case there should be just a score number generated and no other response or comment is allowed.  
YOU HAVE TO COMPARE EACH CLINICAL CASE WITH IT'S DISCHARGE SUMMARY AND THEN Evaluate THE SCALE FEATURES FOR THIS PAIR. 
DO THIS FOR EACH PAIR.
