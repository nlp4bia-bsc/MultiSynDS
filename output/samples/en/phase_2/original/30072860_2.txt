A 72-year-old man with a history of hypertension presented with dyspnea and right-lower-extremity swelling. He was hemodynamically stable. Venous duplex ultrasonograms confirmed right femoral vein thrombosis. At the bifurcation of the pulmonary trunk, a computed tomogram showed a filling defect extending into both main PAs, consistent with saddle embolism. The patient's RV/LV ratio was 1.2, and his PESI score was 132. Echocardiograms revealed severely increased RV size, an RV ejection fraction of 0.10, dilated and akinetic mid-apical free-wall segments, and an RV systolic pressure of 47 mmHg. He underwent ultrasound-assisted catheter-directed thrombolysis with use of an EKOS catheter; a total of 35 mg of alteplase was infused over 14 hours. One day later, he became hypotensive and tachycardic; his oxygen saturation was 86% on 4 L of oxygen. Despite a 10-Î¼g/kg/min dobutamine infusion, he remained hypotensive and had a cardiac index of 2 L/min/m2; cardiac output, 4.4 L/min; MVo2, 59%; mean RAP, 15 mmHg; mean PA pressure, 41 mmHg; and PA pulsatility index, 1.06. We inserted an Impella RP through the patient's right femoral vein into the left PA with the inflow in the proximal inferior vena cava. Subsequently, his pulmonary and hemodynamic function improved: MVo2, 68%; cardiac output, 7.1; cardiac index, 3.1; mean RAP, 22 mmHg; mean PA pressure, 33 mmHg; and PA pulsatility index, 1.27.

During the next 4 days, the patient was weaned from the device and inotropic support. A final echocardiogram revealed substantially improved RV size and systolic pressure, and mildly improved systolic function. He was discharged from the hospital in stable condition, with apixaban prescribed.
