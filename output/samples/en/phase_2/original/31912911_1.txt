Presentation A 67‐year‐old man with acute myocardial infarction in 2005 treated with angioplasty and a coronary stent had low‐risk MDS since 2011, which progressed to AML in 2013. Given his cardiac history, standard induction chemotherapy was contraindicated. In June 2013, subcutaneous AZA was started at the dose of 75 mg/m2, 7 days every 28 days. Just before AZA administration, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 50% with normal filling pressures and antero‐apical akinesia. The patient was receiving angiotensin‐converting‐enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, β‐blocker and 2 antiplatelet drugs.
Investigations His cardiac function gradually decreased after each AZA cycle, with LVEF at 43% in December 2013, 38% in January 2014, and 27% in February 2014 with, at that time, significant CF (increased N‐terminal pro‐brain natriuretic peptide [NT‐proBNP], left ventricular dilatation and increased left filling pressures).
Differential diagnosis No trigger (ischaemia, systemic hypertension, other medications, anaemia, valvulopathy etc.) was identified and renal function and liver parameters remained unchanged.
Treatment and evolution He continued the same cardiac treatment with ACE inhibitor dose adjustment. AZA was suspected to be the cause of the worsening cardiac function, but as no better therapeutic option was available, it was maintained until October 2014 thanks to optimization of his cardiac medication. After 17 cycles of AZA, treatment was no longer efficient and best supportive care was initiated. The patient died in April 2015 from AML.
