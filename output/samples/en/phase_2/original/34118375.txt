A 30-year-old man presented at the emergency department complaining dyspnea, constrictive retrosternal pain, nausea, and profuse sweating. Of note, the patient had suffered from fever (38.8°C) and arthralgia 72 hours earlier when he received his second dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (mRNA BNT162b2), which was injected 21 days after the first dose.

The patient tested negative at nasopharyngeal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2, as required before hospital admission.

Anamnesis was negative for cardiovascular or metabolic disorders and recent infectious diseases.

At physical examination he was afebrile, with moderate tachycardia (heart rate 93 beats/min) and normal blood pressure (115/58 mm Hg). At auscultation, neither lung alterations nor heart murmurs were identified; oxygen saturation was of 99% on room air.

Laboratory data revealed elevated cardiac troponin I (12,564.80 pg/mL; normal < 34.2 pg/mL), creatine kinase-MB (53.8 ng/mL; normal 0-5.2), lactate dehydrogenase (228 U/L; normal 125-220), activated partial thromboplastin time (75.2 seconds; normal 20-40), and C-reactive protein (39.6 mg/L; normal 0-5). White blood cells were 10.4 103/µL (normal 4.0-10.0), with mild eosinophilia (0.9 × 103/µL, normal 0.0-0.5 × 103). Serum levels of cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase-MB, and C-reactive protein during the first 72 hours from hospital admission.

Electrocardiography (ECG) showed subtle ST-segment elevation suggestive of potential myocardial injury or pericarditis in V2-V4 and nonspecific T-wave changes in V5 and V6. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed preserved ejection fraction, mild pericardial effusion, and segmental wall motion abnormality of the apical portion of interventricular septum. No coronary artery disease was found at coronary angiography. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), performed 72 hours after hospital admission, revealed good systolic function and increased myocardial and pericardial signal intensity on T2-weighted short tau inversion recovery sequences (T2 ratio 2.1; normal < 2). T1-weigheted phase-sensitive inversion recovery sequences, performed 15 minutes after intravenous injection of gadolinium, showed subepicardial enhancement of the myocardium, suggesting a provisional diagnosis of myopericarditis.

Extensive infectious and rheumatologic workup was unremarkable. Virus serology did not show IgM antibodies nor 4-fold increase of IgG antibodies for Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, Adenovirus, Enterovirus (Coxsackie A, Coxsackie B1), and human Herpes 1 and 2 viruses.

A quantitative SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay was performed on an Abbott Architect platform (Abbott, Abbott Park, IL). The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant test (Abbott S IgG) quantified antispike post-vaccination titers of > 40,000 AU/mL (range 21,000-40,000 U/mL) at hospital admission and 8,392 U/mL at 1-month follow-up. On the other hand, the patient tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection (antinucleocapsid IgG antibodies) at both time points.

None of the patient's close contacts had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by means of nasopharyngeal swab test or presented any COVID-19–related symptoms. Family history was also negative for rheumatologic or genetic diseases.

The patient was initially treated with bisoprolol and acetylsalicylic acid, with progressive resolution of his symptoms. During his hospitalisation, he also received prednisolone. Seven days after hospital admission a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 was repeated, and the patient tested negative. Cardiac-specific troponin I and creatine kinase-MB progressively decreased and he was discharged home with the recommendation to avoid intense physical activity.
