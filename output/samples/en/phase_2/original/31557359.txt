A 61‐year‐old man, diabetic and hypertensive, presented with heart failure. He had a past history of myocardial infarction with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30%. He had left bundle branch block (LBBB) at baseline and was implanted with a cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillation (CRT‐D) device. During follow‐up after 6 months, his QRS morphology and duration were noted to change depending on whether it was A‐sensed or A‐paced rhythm (Figure ​(Figure1).1). The programming parameters were kept at routine values (PAV of 110 ms, SAV of 90 ms, and VV of −30 ms [left ventricle—LV earlier]). Also, biventricular pacing was confirmed on device interrogation during both A‐sensed and A‐paced beats.

The first ECG shows an A‐paced rhythm with QRS duration (QRSd) of 200 ms, R wave in V1, deep S wave in V5 and V6, and RS pattern in lead II. While during A‐sensed rhythm, the QRSd reduced to 140 ms, RS pattern in V1, smaller S wave in V5 and V6, and QS (W) pattern in lead II. This narrowing of the QRS and a better biventricular (BiV)‐paced morphology during A‐sensed rhythm will ensure better clinical outcome. This is essential to recognize as beta‐blocker used for therapy may cause more atrial pacing causing wider QRS.
