A 46-years-old female was admitted to our department due to worsening of a chronic heart failure with a reduced left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEFâ‰ˆ20%) owed to a post-partum cardiomyopathy. The patient was stable under optimal medical therapy for many years and had already undergone an automatic cardioverter defibrillator implantation. Right heart catheterization revealed a low cardiac output (CO) (2,57 l/min), increased left ventricular filling pressures and fluid congestion. Subsequently high diuretic doses were prescribed in order to decongest the patient.

Unlikely, during the hospital stay the patient developed fever and was diagnosed with Influenza type A. The infection led to hemodynamical instability, so that inotropes and vasopressors were gradually obligatory to maintain adequate circulation. Due to an electrical storm the patient was resuscitated, intubated and transported to the cardiac intensive care unit for further treatment. In that critical situation, the cardiac output was estimated as inadequate for the increased needs of the patient, so that the decision to implant a mechanical support device was met.

After obtaining percutaneously femoral access, the 18Fr special sheath was inserted over a super stiff wire. Then the iVAC2L device was inserted and correctly positioned using a contralaterally inserted pigtail catheter placed on the aortic cusps und thus marking the aortic valve position. This technique raised awareness, that in large ventricles the device could eventually fully dive into the left ventricle and consequently not work properly.

The cardiac output and cardiac index (CI) continuously monitored through a Swan-Ganz catheter, increased from 2.5 L/min and 1.2 L/min/m2 respectively to 5.2 L/min and 2.5 L/min/m2. The device remained in use and effectively supported the patient for more than 48h. However, the patient gradually deteriorated and died in a septic condition, where the systemic vascular resistances continually declined.
