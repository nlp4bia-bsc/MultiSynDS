A 28-year-old woman was admitted to hospital for the treatment of acute heart failure due to severe aortic regurgitation. She had a history of patent ductus arteriosus treated with ligation in infancy. Echocardiography demonstrated left ventricular dysfunction and severe aortic regurgitation due to annuloaortic ectasia. Computed tomography showed thoracic (54 mm) and abdominal aortic aneurysms. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed abnormalities, including straightening and narrowing of the cerebral arteries, a characteristic finding of patients with ACTA-2 gene mutations. The patient underwent successful David procedure after improvement of heart failure. Specimen from the aorta showed a loss of elastic fibers in the media with elastica van Gieson stain. Genetic testing confirmed a mutation of the patientâ€™s ACTA-2 gene (c535C >T:p Arg179Cys). ACTA-2 encodes vascular smooth muscle actins and mutations cause various types of vasculopathy, including aortic disease, coronary artery disease, and stroke.
