A 30-year-old woman with a history of neonatal repair of infracardiac obstructed total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR) presented with dyspnea on exertion. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography performed at presentation showed an anomalous connection—an unligated vertical vein—between the pulmonary venous confluence and portal venous system. The right ventricle was enlarged with depressed function. Transseptal catheterization was performed, and left lower pulmonary venography showed opacification of the confluence with return into the left atrium and into the portal vein through the vertical vein. An Agilis steerable sheath (Abbott Vascular) permitted optimal cannulation of the vertical vein, which measured 16.6× 14 mm. A 22-mm AMPLATZER Vascular Plug II (Abbott Vascular) was deployed through a 7-Fr Pinnacle Destination sheath (Terumo Medical). After deployment, there was no pressure gradient between the left lower pulmonary vein and the left atrium. The patient reported improved exercise tolerance during follow-up.
