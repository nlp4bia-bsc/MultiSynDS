**Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**
- Name: [Patient Name]
- Age: 43 years
- Gender: Female
- Diagnosis: Uterine diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, stage 3B

**Medical History:**
- Chronic renal disease
- Renal replacement therapy (RRT) due to bilateral hydroureteronephrosis secondary to primary uterine disease

**Treatment Summary:**
1. **Surgical Intervention:**
   - Hysterectomy performed.

2. **Chemotherapy:**
   - Initial treatment: Eight cycles of R-CHOP regimen (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone).
   - Due to refractory disease, transitioned to salvage therapy with four cycles of R-ICE protocol (Mesna, ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide phosphate); however, the patient was intolerant to carboplatin.
   - Treatment modified to GEMOX (oxaliplatin, gemcitabine) and completed four cycles.

3. **Radiotherapy:**
   - Underwent 28 sessions of radiotherapy with no signs of oncologic recurrence noted thereafter.

**Cardiac History:**
- Two years post-chemotherapy, the patient was admitted with heart failure (HF). 
- Initial echocardiogram revealed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35%.
- Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy indicated LVEF of 37% with transient hypoperfusion of apical and inferoseptal walls.
- Cineangiography showed no evidence of epicardial coronary disease.

**Subsequent Admissions:**
- The patient experienced four admissions for HF decompensation, the most recent occurring one year ago.
- Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging demonstrated LVEF of 39% with non-ischemic late enhancement of the left ventricular inferolateral wall.

**Current Medications:**
- Carvedilol 25 mg daily
- Losartan 100 mg daily
- Furosemide 40 mg daily

**Assessment:**
- The patient is currently stable. Cardiotoxicity is considered the most likely cause of heart failure with reduced LVEF.

**Cardiac Imaging Timeline:**
- Initial echocardiogram at HF diagnosis showed reduced LVEF.
- Recovery of LVEF noted in 2019, followed by subsequent reductions in later echocardiograms and CMR.
- Retrospective analysis of myocardial uptake via F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT showed increased uptake since chemotherapy initiation, with the highest standard uptake value (SUV) recorded in the last assessment.

**Plan:**
- Continue current medications and monitor cardiac function.
- Schedule follow-up appointments for ongoing evaluation of cardiac status and management of heart failure. 

**Discharge Condition:**
- The patient is discharged in stable condition with instructions for follow-up care.
