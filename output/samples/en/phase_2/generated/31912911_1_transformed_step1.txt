**Diagnosis:** Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) secondary to Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) with a history of acute myocardial infarction.

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a significant medical history of acute myocardial infarction in 2005, for which he underwent angioplasty and placement of a coronary stent. He was diagnosed with low-risk MDS in 2011, which progressed to AML in 2013. Due to his cardiac history, standard induction chemotherapy was contraindicated.

**Treatment Course:**
In June 2013, the patient was initiated on subcutaneous Azacitidine (AZA) at a dosage of 75 mg/m², administered for 7 days every 28 days. Prior to the first AZA administration, the patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured at 50%, with normal filling pressures and evidence of antero-apical akinesia. The patient was concurrently managed with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, a β-blocker, and two antiplatelet medications.

**Investigations:**
Throughout the treatment, the patient's cardiac function progressively declined after each AZA cycle. LVEF measurements showed a decrease to 43% in December 2013, 38% in January 2014, and further to 27% in February 2014, at which point he exhibited significant congestive failure, indicated by elevated N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), left ventricular dilation, and increased left atrial filling pressures. No identifiable triggers for cardiac deterioration, such as ischemia, systemic hypertension, or medication effects, were found, and renal and liver function remained stable.

**Management:**
The patient continued on the same cardiac regimen with adjustments to the ACE inhibitor dosage. Although AZA was suspected to contribute to the worsening cardiac function, it was maintained until October 2014 due to the lack of alternative treatment options and optimization of cardiac medications. After 17 cycles of AZA, the treatment ceased to be effective, and the patient transitioned to best supportive care.

**Outcome:**
The patient ultimately succumbed to complications related to AML in April 2015.

**Follow-Up Recommendations:**
- Continued monitoring of cardiac function and hematologic status in similar cases.
- Consideration of alternative therapies for AML in patients with significant cardiac history.
