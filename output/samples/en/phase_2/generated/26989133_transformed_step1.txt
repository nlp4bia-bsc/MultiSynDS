**Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**
- Name: [Patient's Name]
- Age: 75 years
- Gender: Male
- Ethnicity: Chinese

**Admission Details:**
- Date of Admission: [Admission Date]
- Date of Discharge: [Discharge Date]
- Reason for Admission: Acute anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)

**Clinical Summary:**
The patient presented with 12 hours of central chest pain. An ECG confirmed an acute anterior STEMI, prompting activation of the primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) team. A drug-eluting stent was successfully deployed across the site of complete occlusion in the proximal left anterior descending artery, achieving a door-to-balloon time of 30 minutes.

Post-procedure, the patient developed acute pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock while in the coronary care unit, requiring intravenous inotropes, intubation, mechanical ventilation, and insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump. A new systolic murmur was noted, and echocardiography revealed a ventricular septal rupture (VSR). The patient consented to urgent surgical repair of the VSR using a bovine pericardium patch, which was performed the same day. He was transferred from surgical intensive care 8 days later.

A follow-up echocardiogram showed a residual leak around one edge of the septal patch. The patient was treated conservatively with heart failure medications, including dual antiplatelet therapy, atorvastatin, carvedilol, and frusemide. Due to low blood pressure and severe renal impairment (creatinine 1.6 mg/dL; GFR 42 mL/min), the addition of an ACE inhibitor was not feasible. Prior to discharge, the ECG showed sinus rhythm with new onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) (QRS duration of 176 ms).

**Re-hospitalization:**
Seven days post-discharge, the patient was readmitted for worsening heart failure symptoms. Despite continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation and maximal medical therapy, including levosimendan, he continued to exhibit New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV symptoms. A small left-to-right shunt persisted around the edges of the repaired septum.

**Management Discussion:**
The risks and benefits of three management strategies were discussed with the patient and family:
1. Repeat surgical repair of the VSR, with an anticipated operative mortality exceeding 40%.
2. Palliative treatment for NYHA class IV symptoms.
3. Implantation of a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device, which could improve hemodynamic status but might exacerbate left-to-right shunting.

The patient declined further cardiac surgery but agreed to the implantation of a CRT-pacemaker (CRTP) as a last resort, fully understanding the potential risks involved. The therapeutic goals were to alleviate symptoms and facilitate discharge home.

**Prognosis:**
Given the patient's guarded prognosis and life expectancy potentially not exceeding 12 months, a CRTP was chosen over a CRT-defibrillator, in accordance with international guidelines.

**Follow-Up:**
The patient is advised to follow up with his cardiologist for ongoing management of heart failure symptoms and monitoring of his condition.
