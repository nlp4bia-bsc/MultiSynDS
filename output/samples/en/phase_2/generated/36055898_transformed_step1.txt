**Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**
- Name: [Patient Name]
- Age: 22 years
- Gender: Female
- Admission Date: [Admission Date]
- Discharge Date: [Discharge Date]

**History:**
The patient is a 22-year-old female with a past medical history significant for a seizure episode at age 18. She has a smoking habit and was on oral contraceptives (desogestrel, a progestogen-only pill). The patient is currently breastfeeding her five-month-old son, her first-born child. She presented to the emergency department following a syncopal episode characterized by seizure-like movements lasting approximately five minutes after an intense argument with her boyfriend.

**Clinical Findings:**
- **Vital Signs at Admission:**
  - Heart Rate: 105 bpm
  - Blood Pressure: 109/74 mmHg
- **Physical Examination:**
  - Cardiac and pulmonary auscultation: Normal
  - Denied chest pain, respiratory distress, palpitations, or recent infection.

**Investigations:**
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** Discrete ST-segment elevation (<0.5 mm) in leads II, III, aVF, V2 to V6; corrected QT interval: 474 ms.
- **Arterial Blood Gas Analysis:** Compensated respiratory alkalosis without hypoxemia.
- **Blood Workup:**
  - Normal leukocyte count and C-reactive protein.
  - Elevated N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide: 3300 pg/mL.
  - Positive troponin I: 1.92 ng/mL (cut-off for myocardial infarction >0.1 ng/mL).
  - Elevated D-dimer: 1.2 Î¼g/mL.
- **CT Pulmonary Angiogram:** No abnormalities.
- **Echocardiogram:** Akinesia of midventricular and apical segments; severely depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at 29%. Right ventricle: undilated with normal function; no significant valve disease or pericardial effusion.
- **Coronary Angiography:** No significant lesions in epicardial coronary arteries.
- **Ventriculography:** Apical ballooning with moderately depressed LVEF.

**Differential Diagnosis:**
1. Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA)
2. Myocarditis
3. Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM)
4. Takotsubo syndrome (TTS)

**Treatment Initiated:**
- Bromocriptine
- Carvedilol
- Captopril
- Spironolactone

**Hospital Course:**
During her hospital stay, the patient remained clinically and hemodynamically stable. A follow-up echocardiogram performed five days post-admission showed improvement in LVEF and wall motion abnormalities. A cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) performed seven days after admission revealed a non-dilated left ventricle with normal LVEF (55%), no wall motion abnormalities, and absence of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). A neurologist evaluated the patient, and both an electroencephalogram and brain MRI were normal.

**Discharge Medications:**
- Bisoprolol 5 mg once daily

**Follow-Up:**
The patient was referred to the cardiology outpatient clinic. A follow-up echocardiogram performed two months post-discharge demonstrated preserved LVEF, with a normal QT interval and resolution of repolarization abnormalities on ECG.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue prescribed medications.
- Attend scheduled follow-up appointments with the cardiology clinic.
- Monitor for any recurrence of symptoms and seek medical attention if necessary.
