**Diagnosis:**
1. End-stage heart failure, INTERMACS profile 4
2. Symptomatic enlarging infra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)

**History:**
The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He was referred for management of symptomatic end-stage heart failure. 

**Clinical Findings:**
- Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed:
  - Left ventricular ejection fraction: 10%
  - Left ventricular diastolic diameter: 7.7 cm
  - Moderate tricuspid regurgitation
- Left and right heart catheterization indicated:
  - Significant left main and triple vessel disease
  - Cardiac index: 1.65 l/min/m²
  - Pulmonary vascular resistance: 3.67 Woods units
- Thallium myocardial perfusion scan showed non-viable myocardium.
- CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated an AAA measuring 5.8 × 6 cm, which progressed to 6.9 × 6.6 cm over 6 months.

**Surgical Intervention:**
Due to the patient's poor cardiac function, general anesthesia was initially refused by the referral hospital. A multi-disciplinary team decided on an implantable left ventricular assist device (LVAD) with HeartMate 3 as a bridge to transplant, along with sequential open AAA repair.

**Procedure Details:**
1. **LVAD Implantation:**
   - General anesthesia was administered.
   - Median sternotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass were established.
   - Tricuspid annuloplasty was performed using a Sovering Tricuspid Band (size 30).
   - LVAD inflow cannula was attached to the left ventricular apex; outflow graft was sewn onto the ascending aorta.
   - LVAD flow was adjusted to 3 LPM with trans-oesophageal echocardiogram guidance.
   - The patient was extubated on postoperative Day 2.

2. **Open AAA Repair:**
   - Conducted on postoperative Day 7.
   - Heparin infusion was stopped 4 hours prior to surgery.
   - Low-dose adrenaline and dopamine were administered for right heart support.
   - The AAA was dissected and repaired using a 20-mm Hemashield woven Dacron tube graft.
   - Cross-clamp time was 55 minutes; operating time was 139 minutes with minimal blood loss (50 ml).
   - The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure.

**Postoperative Course:**
The patient had an uneventful recovery. He was maintained on aspirin and warfarin with a target INR of 2–3. He was discharged home on postoperative Day 30.

**Follow-Up:**
A follow-up CT scan post-discharge showed complete repair of the AAA.

**Instructions for Home Care:**
- Continue prescribed medications (aspirin and warfarin).
- Monitor INR levels regularly.
- Follow up with the cardiology and vascular surgery clinics as scheduled.
