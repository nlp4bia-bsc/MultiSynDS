**Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**
- Name: [Patient Name]
- Age: 32 years
- Gender: Female
- Admission Date: [Admission Date]
- Discharge Date: [Discharge Date]

**Admission Diagnosis:**
- Progressive shortness of breath

**Medical History:**
- End-stage renal failure secondary to chronic pyelonephritis
- Cadaveric renal transplant in 2010
- History of haemodialysis via proximal left radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula
- Previous episodes of reduced graft function due to chronic urinary tract infections

**Medications on Admission:**
- Prograf 4 mg twice daily
- Mycophenolate 1 g twice daily
- Amlodipine 5 mg daily
- Aranesp 30 µg weekly
- Bisoprolol 5 mg daily
- Calcium acetate 1 g three times daily with meals
- Ranitidine 150 mg daily
- Sodium bicarbonate 2 g twice daily
- Prednisolone 30 mg daily (reducing regime for wheeze and dyspnoea)

**Clinical Presentation:**
The patient presented with a 2-week history of progressive shortness of breath, which began 1 month prior after a course of flucloxacillin for paronychia. Symptoms included exertional dyspnoea, wheezing, and chest tightness, without pleuritic pain, palpitations, or cough. 

**Physical Examination:**
- Respiratory rate: 16/min
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on room air
- Blood pressure: 186/105 mm Hg
- Heart rate: 115 beats/min
- Pansystolic murmur noted, loudest over the left lower sternal edge
- Raised jugular venous pressure observed
- Abdominal examination revealed a mass in the right iliac fossa consistent with renal transplant

**Investigations:**
- ECG: Sinus tachycardia, normal cardiac axis
- Chest radiograph: Minor pulmonary vascular congestion
- Blood tests: Microcytic anaemia (Hb 94 g/L), renal function impairment (creatinine 381 µmol/L), normal liver function tests except slightly raised ALT
- Transthoracic echocardiogram: Normal left ventricle, moderate biatrial enlargement, mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, elevated right ventricular systolic pressure suggestive of pulmonary hypertension
- Doppler ultrasound of left radiocephalic fistula: High output fistula confirmed
- Cardiac MRI: Normal ejection fraction, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, incidental bilateral pleural effusions

**Diagnosis:**
- High-output cardiac failure secondary to high-output arteriovenous fistula

**Treatment:**
- Ligation of the left radiocephalic fistula performed under local anaesthetic without complications
- Postoperative echocardiography showed normal left ventricular function and reduced pulmonary arterial systolic pressure

**Outcome:**
The patient experienced marked improvement in shortness of breath and exercise tolerance postoperatively. Follow-up echocardiography demonstrated sustained improvements in pulmonary arterial systolic pressure. The patient remains clinically well and will continue routine nephrology follow-up.

**Follow-Up:**
- Regular nephrology follow-up appointments scheduled
- Monitoring for any recurrence of symptoms or complications
