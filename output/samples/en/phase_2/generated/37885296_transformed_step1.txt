**Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**
- **Name:** [Patient Name]
- **Age:** 40 years
- **Gender:** Female
- **Medical History:** Basal cell skin cancer of the left shoulder

**Admission Details:**
- **Date of Admission:** [Admission Date]
- **Date of Discharge:** [Discharge Date]
- **Reason for Admission:** Heart failure (HF) of high functional class

**Clinical Findings:**
- Echocardiography revealed a mass in the left atrium, causing critical mitral stenosis and obstructing the outflow from the left atrium. 

**Surgical Interventions:**
1. **Initial Operation:**
   - **Procedure:** Resection of left atrial mass
   - **Mass Characteristics:** Oval lobular tissue, light yellow, soft elastic consistency, measuring 4.0 × 4.5 × 3.5 cm.
   - **Histological Findings:** Small cell tumor from the endocardium, diagnosed as inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor.
   - **Postoperative Complications:** Postpericardiotomy syndrome, successfully treated.

2. **Second Operation (2 years later):**
   - **Indication:** Recurrence of high-functional HF and severe obstruction of the mitral valve.
   - **Procedure:** Emergency resection of left atrial mass via right atrium and interatrial septum.
   - **Mass Characteristics:** 5.0 × 4.0 × 2.5 cm, lobulated, partially covered with smooth endocardium.
   - **Histological Findings:** Diagnosed as myxofibrosarcoma.

3. **Heart Transplant:**
   - **Indication:** Severe obstruction of the mitral valve and high risk of embolic complications.
   - **Procedure:** Heart transplant performed using the Dreyfus technique, preserving the posterior wall of the left atrium.
   - **Mass Characteristics:** 5 × 4 × 4 cm, exophytic tumor with invasion into the mitral valve cusps.
   - **Histological Findings:** Diagnosed as myxofibrosarcoma, grade 1, with creeping growth along the endocardium.

**Postoperative Course:**
- The patient experienced a crisis of antibody-mediated rejection grade 2, successfully managed by day 30 post-surgery.
- Currently receiving standard immunosuppressive therapy.

**Follow-Up and Recommendations:**
- Control imaging (CT and PET-CT) at 4 months post-transplant showed no tumor presence.
- Genome sequencing recommended to identify potential mutations for targeted therapy, as no amplification of ALK, KRAS, TP53, and RB1 genes was found.

**Current Status:**
- The patient is stable and will continue regular follow-up with an oncologist and cardiologist.

**Instructions for Care:**
- Adhere to immunosuppressive therapy regimen.
- Schedule regular follow-up appointments for monitoring heart function and potential tumor recurrence.
