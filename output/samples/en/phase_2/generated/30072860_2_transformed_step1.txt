- **Date of Discharge:** [Discharge Date]

**Admission Diagnosis:**
- Right femoral vein thrombosis
- Saddle pulmonary embolism
- Right ventricular dysfunction

**Clinical Summary:**
The patient, a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension, presented with dyspnea and swelling in the right lower extremity. Upon examination, he was hemodynamically stable. Diagnostic imaging, including venous duplex ultrasonograms, confirmed the presence of right femoral vein thrombosis. A computed tomogram of the chest revealed a filling defect at the bifurcation of the pulmonary trunk, consistent with saddle embolism.

Echocardiographic evaluation indicated severely increased right ventricular (RV) size, an RV ejection fraction of 10%, and dilated, akinetic mid-apical free-wall segments. The RV/LV ratio was measured at 1.2, and the patient's Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) score was 132.

**Interventions:**
The patient underwent ultrasound-assisted catheter-directed thrombolysis using an EKOS catheter, with a total of 35 mg of alteplase infused over 14 hours. However, one day post-procedure, the patient experienced hypotension and tachycardia, with oxygen saturation dropping to 86% on 4 L of supplemental oxygen. Despite initiating a dobutamine infusion at 10 Î¼g/kg/min, he remained hypotensive.

To support hemodynamic stability, an Impella RP device was inserted via the right femoral vein into the left pulmonary artery, with inflow positioned in the proximal inferior vena cava. Following this intervention, the patient's pulmonary and hemodynamic parameters improved significantly, with a cardiac output of 7.1 L/min and a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 33 mmHg.

**Progress and Disposition:**
Over the subsequent four days, the patient was successfully weaned off the Impella device and inotropic support. A final echocardiogram demonstrated substantial improvement in RV size and systolic pressure, along with mild enhancement in systolic function.

**Discharge Medications:**
- Apixaban

**Discharge Condition:**
The patient was discharged in stable condition, with instructions for follow-up care and medication adherence.

**Follow-Up:**
The patient is advised to follow up with his primary care physician and a cardiologist within one week of discharge.
