**Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**
- **Age:** 40s
- **Gender:** Male
- **Admission Date:** 2015
- **Discharge Date:** [Insert Date]

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient was admitted with a primary complaint of backache.

**Clinical Findings:**
- **Laboratory Results:**
  - Increased Immunoglobulin G (IgG): 50.1 g/L
  - Increased Creatinine: 103.9 μmol/L
  - Increased Calcium: 4.12 mmol/L
  - Decreased Hemoglobin: 74 g/L
- **Bone Marrow Analysis:**
  - Infiltration with 23.5% plasma cells.
- **Imaging Studies:**
  - X-ray: Compression changes in the fourth lumbar (L4) vertebra; destruction of the first lumbar (L1) vertebra.
  - Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT): High uptake of 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate in multiple bones.
- **Diagnosis:** Immunoglobulin G Multiple Myeloma (IgG MM) without extramedullary involvement or renal dysfunction.

**Treatment History:**
1. **Initial Treatment (2015):** 
   - Four cycles of vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone; symptom relief achieved.
   - Treatment adjusted to bortezomib and dexamethasone due to elevated IgG levels (41.6 g/L).

2. **Disease Progression (2017):**
   - Severe backache and increased plasma cells (35.5%).
   - Treated with three cycles of bortezomib and dexamethasone.

3. **Further Progression (October 2018):**
   - Disease progression led to three cycles of bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone; no improvement noted.

4. **Subsequent Treatment (July 2019):**
   - Two cycles of bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone.

5. **Intestinal Infiltration (December 2019):**
   - CT showed thickened intestinal wall; initiated ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone therapy.
   - Detected descending colon infiltration and worsening melena.

6. **Cardiac Dysfunction (January 2020):**
   - Diagnosed with cardiac dysfunction; NT-proBNP elevated (4253 pg/mL), EF decreased (47%).
   - Treated with bortezomib, doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome, and dexamethasone; heart failure managed with hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone.

7. **Compassionate Use of CAR-T Therapy (February 2020):**
   - Lymphodepletion followed by anti-BCMA CAR-T cell infusion.
   - Developed grade I cytokine release syndrome, managed with NSAIDs; moderate side effects observed.

**Outcomes:**
- **Cardiac Improvement:** NT-proBNP decreased to 6358 pg/mL, EF improved to 56% within one week post-CAR-T therapy.
- **Renal Function:** Creatinine decreased to 82.6 μmol/L, GFR improved to 93.53 mL/min/1.73 m².
- **Hematological Response:** IgG decreased to 26.7 g/L; achieved negative minimal residual disease status.

**Follow-Up:**
- **1-Year Follow-Up:** Maintained complete response with negative serum and urine protein electrophoresis. NT-proBNP at 738.1 pg/mL, EF at 54%.
- **2-Year Follow-Up:** Patient remained healthy, no heart failure or hematological relapse. Cardiac function improved (EF 63%, NT-proBNP 520 pg/mL). Echocardiography indicated features consistent with AL-CA.

**Conclusion:**
The patient demonstrated significant improvement in both cardiac and hematological parameters following anti-BCMA CAR-T cell therapy, effectively managing severe heart failure associated with multiple myeloma. Continued monitoring and follow-up are recommended to ensure sustained health and response.

**Recommendations:**
- Regular follow-up appointments for cardiac and hematological assessments.
- Monitoring for any signs of relapse or heart failure.
