**Patient Information:**
- **Name:** [Patient Name]
- **Age:** 62 years
- **Gender:** Male
- **Date of Admission:** [Admission Date]
- **Date of Discharge:** [Discharge Date]

**Diagnosis:**
- Heart transplantation for arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy of the right ventricle.
- SARS-CoV-2 infection.
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- Pneumonia.
- Anemia and leukopenia.

**Hospital Course:**
The patient underwent heart transplantation on November 2, 2019. Post-transplant, he experienced multiple complications, including pneumonia and ARDS, necessitating 56 days of mechanical ventilation and intermittent renal replacement therapy. Echocardiography indicated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55% with no signs of transplant rejection. The immunosuppression regimen included cyclosporine A (target range 135 ± 30 ng/mL), mycophenolate mofetil 500 mg b.i.d., and prednisone 10 mg q.d. No anti-lymphocyte globulins were used for induction therapy.

On March 13, 2020, the patient presented with fever (39.9°C), tachycardia (105 bpm), and sore throat. PCR testing confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Body temperature normalized within 12 hours, and blood oxygen saturation remained stable (96%-100%) without supplemental oxygen. The patient exhibited mild rhinorrhea and impaired exercise capacity, but no cough or dyspnea at rest.

On day 7, a second fever episode (38.4°C) occurred, resolving spontaneously. This coincided with mild elevations in C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (proBNP), and lymphopenia. A CT scan revealed post-inflammatory changes from previous pneumonia and ARDS, with no evidence of COVID-19 pneumonia or bacterial superinfection. Procalcitonin levels were low, and blood cultures were negative for bacterial or fungal growth.

Hydroxychloroquine was administered from day 7 to 14. Despite the patient being asymptomatic by day 20, SARS-CoV-2 PCR remained positive on multiple days up to day 35, with confirmed active virus replication on days 18 and 21.

ProBNP levels fluctuated with inflammatory markers, raising suspicion for COVID-19-related myocardial infection, though this was not confirmed via myocardial biopsy. Throughout the hospitalization, the patient showed no signs of clinical deterioration or cardiorespiratory impairment. Successful weaning from hemodialysis occurred on day 1, with stable urine output and body weight. The cyclosporine A dosage was adjusted to maintain therapeutic levels. Prednisone was increased to 50 mg for 3 days and then to 25 mg for an additional 3 days starting on day 14 to manage acute gout in the left knee.

**Medications at Discharge:**
- Cyclosporine A (adjusted to maintain therapeutic range)
- Mycophenolate mofetil 500 mg b.i.d.
- Prednisone (tapering dose)
- Valganciclovir prophylaxis
- Hydroxychloroquine (completed course)

**Follow-Up:**
The patient is advised to follow up with the transplant team and primary care physician for ongoing management of immunosuppression and monitoring for any potential complications.
