**Clinical Summary:**
The patient, a 61-year-old male with a history of diabetes and hypertension, presented with heart failure. He has a significant past medical history of myocardial infarction, resulting in a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30%. The patient was found to have a left bundle branch block (LBBB) at baseline and was subsequently implanted with a cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillation (CRT-D) device.

**Follow-Up and Findings:**
During a follow-up visit after 6 months, changes in QRS morphology and duration were observed, which varied based on whether the rhythm was A-sensed or A-paced. The programming parameters of the CRT-D device were maintained at routine values: PAV of 110 ms, SAV of 90 ms, and VV of -30 ms (with the left ventricle paced earlier). Device interrogation confirmed biventricular pacing during both A-sensed and A-paced beats.

**Electrocardiogram (ECG) Findings:**
1. **A-Paced Rhythm:**
   - QRS Duration (QRSd): 200 ms
   - R wave in V1
   - Deep S wave in V5 and V6
   - RS pattern in lead II

2. **A-Sensed Rhythm:**
   - QRS Duration (QRSd): 140 ms
   - RS pattern in V1
   - Smaller S wave in V5 and V6
   - QS (W) pattern in lead II

The observed narrowing of the QRS complex and improved biventricular-paced morphology during A-sensed rhythm is anticipated to yield a better clinical outcome. It is crucial to note that the beta-blocker therapy may lead to increased atrial pacing, which could result in a wider QRS complex.

**Plan and Recommendations:**
- Continue monitoring cardiac function and device performance.
- Adjust beta-blocker therapy as needed to optimize pacing and QRS duration.
- Schedule follow-up appointments to assess heart failure management and device settings.
