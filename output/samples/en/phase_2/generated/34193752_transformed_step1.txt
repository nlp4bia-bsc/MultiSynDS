**Chief Complaint:**
The patient was admitted for the management of acute heart failure secondary to severe aortic regurgitation.

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient has a significant medical history of patent ductus arteriosus, which was treated with ligation during infancy. She presented with symptoms consistent with acute heart failure.

**Investigations:**
- **Echocardiography:** Revealed left ventricular dysfunction and severe aortic regurgitation attributed to annuloaortic ectasia.
- **Computed Tomography (CT):** Identified thoracic (54 mm) and abdominal aortic aneurysms.
- **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Brain:** Showed abnormalities, including straightening and narrowing of the cerebral arteries, suggestive of ACTA-2 gene mutations.

**Treatment:**
The patient underwent a successful David procedure following stabilization of her heart failure symptoms. 

**Pathology:**
Specimen analysis from the aorta indicated a loss of elastic fibers in the media, confirmed by elastica van Gieson staining.

**Genetic Testing:**
Genetic analysis confirmed a mutation in the ACTA-2 gene (c535C >T:p Arg179Cys), which is associated with various forms of vasculopathy, including aortic disease, coronary artery disease, and stroke.

**Discharge Condition:**
The patient is stable and has shown significant improvement post-surgery. 

**Follow-Up:**
The patient is advised to follow up with her cardiologist and genetic counselor for ongoing management and monitoring of her condition.
