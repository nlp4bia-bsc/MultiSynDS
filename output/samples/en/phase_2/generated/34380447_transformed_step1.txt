- Initial Vital Signs:
  - Blood Pressure: 90/40 mmHg
  - Pulse Rate: 68 bpm
  - Respiratory Rate: 20 breaths/min
  - Body Temperature: 38.3 °C

**Medical History:**
- No known underlying diseases.
- History of raising rabbits, dogs, and chickens on the property.
- No memory of insect bites.

**Physical Examination:**
- No eschar or skin rash observed.

**Laboratory Findings:**
- Bicytopenia:
  - White Blood Cell Count: 1200/mm³ (Neutrophil Count: 280/μL)
  - Hemoglobin Level: 13.9 g/dL
  - Platelet Count: 113,000/mm³
- Elevated Serum Levels:
  - C-reactive Protein: 0.05 mg/dL
  - Ferritin: 3970.62 ng/mL
  - AST: 67 U/L
  - ALT: 28 U/L
  - LDH: 781 U/L
- Normal cardiac enzymes (Troponin I, CK-MB).
- ECG: Normal sinus rhythm, no cardiomegaly or pulmonary congestion on chest X-ray.

**Clinical Course:**
- Suspected tick-borne disorder (SFTS) and possible hematologic disorder.
- Blood cultures and various tests (RT-PCR, immunofluorescence, hemagglutination) were performed.
- Bone marrow sample indicated hypocellular marrow, suggesting marrow failure due to systemic infection.

**Hospital Day 3:**
- Patient experienced chest discomfort; blood pressure dropped to 55/37 mmHg, bradycardia developed (43 bpm).
- Chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema; serum troponin I elevated (1.60 ng/mL).
- Laboratory results indicated worsening bicytopenia.
- Bedside echocardiography revealed severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction 10%).
- Coronary angiography showed good distal flow with no significant stenosis.
- Due to severe orthopnea and shock, VA ECMO was initiated.

**Diagnosis:**
- Positive for SFTSV on blood test.
- Initiated immune suppressive therapy with prednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin.

**Subsequent Hospital Days:**
- HD 4: Persistent bicytopenia; troponin level elevated.
- HD 7: Heart function began to improve.
- HD 12: Successfully weaned off VA ECMO.
- HD 21: Complete recovery of cardiac function.

**Discharge Condition:**
- The patient was discharged without significant complications.

**Follow-Up:**
- Recommended follow-up with primary care physician and cardiology for ongoing monitoring.
