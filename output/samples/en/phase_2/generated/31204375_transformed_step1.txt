- **Discharge Date:** [Discharge Date]

**Reason for Admission:**
The patient was admitted with acute heart failure secondary to severe aortic stenosis (AS).

**Clinical Findings:**
- The patient was identified as a high-risk candidate for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) with a logistic EuroSCORE of 18.3% and a Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality of 11.2%.
- Imaging studies, including computed tomography (CT) and aortography, revealed:
  - Severe calcification and stenosis of the peripheral arteries.
  - Severe stenosis of the right common iliac artery and occlusion of the left external iliac artery.
  - Stenosis and calcification of the left subclavian artery.
  - Severe calcification at the sinotubular junction, posing a risk for aortic dissection during transapical (TA) and transaortic (TAo) TAVI procedures.

**Procedure:**
Due to the patient's vascular anatomy and severe calcification, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) via transapical approach was performed using a self-expanding bioprosthetic valve. The procedure details are as follows:
- **Anesthesia:** General anesthesia with mechanical ventilation.
- **Surgical Approach:** Reverse L-shaped lower hemisternotomy from the right second intercostal space to the xiphoid process.
- **Access:** A 5-Fr pigtail catheter was inserted through the left radial artery, and an epicardial pacing lead was placed on the right ventricle.
- **Aortography:** Conducted to measure a distance of 60 mm from the aortic annulus.
- **Vascular Graft:** A 10-mm diameter vascular graft was sutured to the ascending aorta at a 45Â° angle under partial aortic clamp.
- **Valve Implantation:** An 18 Fr DrySeal sheath was inserted into the graft, followed by predilation of the native aortic valve with a 20-mm Z-MED II balloon. A 29 mm CoreValve Evolut-R bioprosthetic valve was then implanted.

**Post-Procedure Findings:**
- Transesophageal echocardiography indicated mild paravalvular leakage.
- Aortography showed mild aortic regurgitation with patent coronary arteries.
- The vascular graft was ligated and resected after sheath extraction.

**Duration of Procedure:**
188 minutes

**Clinical Course:**
The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he demonstrated stable vital signs throughout his hospital stay.

**Discharge Instructions:**
- Follow-up appointments should be scheduled with the cardiology team.
- Monitor for any signs of complications such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling.
- Continue prescribed medications and adhere to lifestyle modifications as discussed.
