**Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**
- **Name:** [Patient Name]
- **Age:** 80 years
- **Gender:** Male
- **Occupation:** Former construction worker (roof and ceiling placement)

**Admission Details:**
- **Date of Admission:** [Admission Date]
- **Date of Discharge:** [Discharge Date]
- **Reason for Admission:** Decompensated heart failure

**Clinical Findings:**
- **Chest Radiograph (CRX):** Demonstrated cardiomegaly, bibasal congestion, and well-defined focal areas suggestive of pleural calcifications.
- **High-Resolution Chest Computed Tomography (HRCT):** Revealed multiple gross calcifications, with some areas showing pleural thickening consistent with pleural plaques (PP).
- **Pulmonary Function Tests, Bronchofibroscopy, and Pleural Biopsies:** No significant alterations noted.

**Diagnosis:**
- Decompensated heart failure secondary to underlying conditions related to asbestos exposure, including pleural plaques.

**Treatment Provided:**
- Initiated diuretics and optimized disease-modifying heart failure therapy, resulting in improvement and resolution of symptoms.

**Discussion:**
The patient has a history of asbestos exposure, a known risk factor for both thoracic malignancies and non-malignant respiratory diseases, including asbestosis, pleural plaques, and diffuse pleural thickening. Pleural plaques are one of the earliest and most common manifestations of asbestos exposure, typically appearing 20-30 years post-exposure and affecting over half of individuals in occupational settings. While usually asymptomatic, pleural plaques can lead to a decline in lung function. Diagnosis is primarily based on radiographic findings and a history of exposure, with CRX being the standard diagnostic method, though HRCT is more effective in detecting subtle non-calcified plaques.

**Follow-Up:**
Despite being asymptomatic, the patient will continue to have follow-up appointments in the outpatient setting to monitor his condition.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue monitoring for any respiratory symptoms.
- Regular follow-up with cardiology and pulmonology as needed.
