**Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**
- **Patient ID:** II
- **Age:** 61 years
- **Gender:** Male

**Medical History:**
- Longstanding ischemic heart failure post-posterior wall myocardial infarction (2002).
- Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (2012).
- Left ventricular assist device (LVAD, HVAD HeartWare) implantation due to advanced heart failure symptoms (2013).
- Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD, Biotronik Lumax 540 DR-T) placed (2010) following recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT).

**Clinical Course:**
- Since 2020, the patient experienced recurrent episodes of VT, managed with electrical cardioversion and intensified antiarrhythmic drug therapy (AADT).
- In July 2021, the patient suffered an electrical storm with five consecutive shocks, necessitating further escalation of AADT.
- Presenting with NYHA class III heart failure symptoms and evidence of end-organ failure.
- Coronary angiogram showed no new stenosis.
- Electroanatomical mapping (CARTO 3) identified low-voltage areas in the inferolateral left ventricle near the LVAD cannula.
- Catheter ablation in the inferolateral area was unsuccessful in restoring normal rhythm, resulting in a change in VT morphology.
- The patient remained stable with slow VT, tolerated under LVAD therapy, with a cardiac output of 4.5–5 L/min.

**Treatment Plan:**
- Radiation therapy was administered using Varian True BeamTM STX to accommodate the patient's reduced cardiopulmonary status and minimize treatment duration.
- The internal target volume (ITV) was expanded by 4 mm to create the planning target volume (PTV).
- Treatment planning utilized Varian EclipseTM (version 15.5) with four noncoplanar volumetric modulated arcs employing 6-MV flattening filter-free photon beams, with dose distribution calculated via the AAA/Acuros AXB algorithm.

**Follow-Up:**
- Post-radioablation, the patient exhibited a complex clinical trajectory, with VT initially persisting but gradually decelerating from 190 bpm to 130 bpm within the first 6 days, and further to 100–110 bpm over the next 14 days.
- AADT was cautiously reduced; however, an attempt at external cardioversion two weeks post-ablation was unsuccessful.
- Three weeks after the procedure, VT accelerated again to approximately 140 bpm.
- A bilateral stellate ganglion block provided temporary relief, allowing pacemaker control of heart rate for several days before VT re-accelerated as the effect waned.
- The patient ultimately succumbed to progressive end-organ failure 50 days following the radioablation procedure.

**Disposition:**
- The patient was discharged with a focus on palliative care and symptom management due to the progressive nature of his condition.
