**Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**
- Name: [Patient's Name]
- Age: 57 years
- Gender: Male
- Ethnicity: Caucasian

**Admission Details:**
- Date of Admission: [Admission Date]
- Date of Discharge: [Discharge Date]
- Admitting Physician: [Physician's Name]
- Admission Diagnosis: Acute Heart Failure (AHF) with cardiogenic shock and respiratory failure secondary to carbon monoxide (CO) intoxication.

**Clinical Summary:**
The patient was admitted to the Emergency Department presenting with anxiety, confusion, tachycardia, and dyspnea. He had no significant past medical history and reported no medication use, alcohol consumption, or smoking. Upon admission, vital signs indicated:
- Heart Rate: 110 bpm
- Blood Pressure: 180/90 mmHg
- SpO2: 90% on ambient air
- Respiratory Rate: 25 breaths/min
- Normal axillary temperature.

Physical examination revealed:
- Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, normal heart sounds, holosystolic murmur at the apex.
- Respiratory: Symmetrical thoracic activity, normal expansion, bilateral end-inspiratory crackles.
- Neurological: Alert, responsive to simple questions, normal pupils and neurological examination.
- Extremities: Cold, no edema.

**Investigations:**
- Arterial Blood Gas: Respiratory acidosis with hyperlactatemia, increased anion gap, COHb > 15%.
- Chest X-Ray: Pulmonary edema.
- ECG: Sinus tachycardia with ST-segment elevation in V1-V6.
- Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE): Ejection fraction 20-25%, severe mitral regurgitation.

**Hospital Course:**
The patient rapidly decompensated, developing hypotension and worsening hypoxemia, leading to admission to the ICU. He received ventilatory and circulatory support, including orotracheal intubation, lung protective mechanical ventilation, and inotropic support. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was initiated until COHb levels normalized.

Laboratory results showed elevated cardiac necrosis markers (CK, CK-MB, troponin, LDH) and slightly elevated NT-proBNP. Coronary angiography revealed no stenosis, suggesting ECG changes were due to coronary vasospasm from CO intoxication.

After 12 hours of mechanical support, the patient showed significant improvement in lung function and hemodynamic stability. A repeat TTE indicated improved ejection fraction (50-60%) and resolution of mitral regurgitation. The patient was extubated and transferred to the Internal Medicine ward for further monitoring.

**Discharge Condition:**
The patient remained stable for two days before being discharged. However, he was re-admitted three days later with similar cardiovascular symptoms, showing decreased ejection fraction and elevated COHb levels (> 20%). Despite prompt treatment and resuscitative measures, the patient succumbed to acute cardiac failure and cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity (PEA).

**Follow-Up:**
- Recommended follow-up with cardiology and internal medicine.
- Monitoring for potential long-term effects of CO exposure.
