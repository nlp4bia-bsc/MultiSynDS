- Gender: Female

**Medical History:**
- History of neonatal repair of infracardiac obstructed total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR).

**Presenting Complaint:**
- The patient presented with dyspnea on exertion.

**Investigations:**
- Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography were performed upon presentation, revealing an anomalous connection—specifically, an unligated vertical vein—between the pulmonary venous confluence and the portal venous system.
- Notable findings included enlargement of the right ventricle with depressed function.

**Procedures:**
- Transseptal catheterization was conducted.
- Left lower pulmonary venography demonstrated opacification of the confluence with return into the left atrium and into the portal vein via the vertical vein.
- An Agilis steerable sheath (Abbott Vascular) was utilized for optimal cannulation of the vertical vein, which measured 16.6 × 14 mm.
- A 22-mm AMPLATZER Vascular Plug II (Abbott Vascular) was successfully deployed through a 7-Fr Pinnacle Destination sheath (Terumo Medical).
- Post-deployment assessment indicated no pressure gradient between the left lower pulmonary vein and the left atrium.

**Follow-Up:**
- The patient reported improved exercise tolerance during follow-up.

**Discharge Condition:**
- The patient is stable and has been discharged with instructions for follow-up care. 

**Recommendations:**
- Continue monitoring for any signs of complications.
