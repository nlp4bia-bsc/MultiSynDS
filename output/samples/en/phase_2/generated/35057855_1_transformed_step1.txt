**Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**
- Name: [Patient's Name]
- Age: 75 years
- Gender: Female
- Ethnicity: Japanese
- Height: 150 cm
- Weight: 43 kg

**Admission Details:**
- Date of Admission: [Admission Date]
- Date of Discharge: [Discharge Date]
- Reason for Admission: Worsening heart failure (HF) due to ischemic cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 35%.

**Medical History:**
- Diabetes mellitus
- Smoking history
- Peripheral artery disease (PAD) diagnosed at age 73
- Above-knee amputation due to ischemic and diabetic necrosis (1 year prior)

**Clinical Findings:**
- Symptoms of heart failure improved with Fowler’s position and treatment (diuretics, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors).
- Complained of rest pain in the right lower leg one week post-admission.
- Physical examination revealed absent pedal pulses and shiny, smooth, cold, pale skin of the right leg.
- Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was unmeasurable at rest.

**Diagnostic Imaging:**
- CT angiogram indicated chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the right superficial femoral artery (SFA) and left external iliac artery.
- Diagnosed with critical limb ischemia (Fontaine stage III).

**Intervention:**
- Decision made to perform peripheral vascular intervention (PVI) for revascularization of the right SFA due to severe, uncontrolled pain.
- Patient maintained in Fowler’s position during the procedure.
- A 7 Fr R2P Glidesheath slender sheath was inserted, and a 7 Fr SlenGuide catheter was advanced into the right iliac artery.
- Initial angiography revealed total occlusion of the left SFA.
- A 0.014 inch Halberd guidewire was successfully advanced into the right SFA, followed by dilation of the lesion with a 4.0–100 mm Metacross balloon catheter.
- Two 6.0–100 mm R2P Misago stents were implanted in the CTO lesion of the right SFA.
- Postdilation of the stents was performed, confirming favorable blood flow below the right knee without residual stenosis or dissection.
- Hemostasis was achieved at the puncture site using a TR Band device.

**Postoperative Course:**
- Heart failure did not worsen during or after the procedure.
- ABI improved to 0.78 in the right leg.
- Patient discharged one week post-PVI.

**Follow-Up:**
- At 6 months post-PVI, the patient reported complete relief from pain in the right lower leg.
- ABI at rest maintained at 0.72.
- Chronic heart failure managed effectively with medical therapy.

**Recommendations:**
- Continue regular follow-up for heart failure management and vascular health.
- Monitor for any signs of limb ischemia or cardiovascular complications.
