**Chief Complaint:**
Refractory congestive heart failure (NYHA Functional Class III-IV) despite optimal medical treatment.

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient was admitted with a history of refractory congestive heart failure, arterial hypertension, chronic renal failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He has a significant past medical history including myocardial revascularization and aortic valve replacement in 2001, and an ischemic stroke in 2003.

**Clinical Findings:**
Upon admission, laboratory tests revealed:
- Impaired kidney function: Urea 88 g/dL, Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
- Anemia: Hemoglobin 7 g/dL
- Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 1100 mg/dL
- Grade 3 indirect hyperbilirubinemia, suggestive of hemolytic anemia.

Echocardiography (both transthoracic and transesophageal) indicated severely compromised ventricular function and a mechanical prosthetic valve with a paravalvular leak (PVL), characterized by a severe regurgitant jet measuring 8.5 mm in width and a regurgitant area of 43 mmÂ².

**Surgical Risk Assessment:**
The EuroSCORE II calculated a surgical mortality risk of 53.41%, prompting the decision for percutaneous closure of the PVL.

**Procedure:**
The patient was hemodynamically unstable and required mechanical ventilation and sedation. Following the administration of 10,000 IU of sodium heparin and prophylaxis for infective endocarditis, a percutaneous closure of the PVL was performed under fluoroscopic and transesophageal echocardiographic guidance. 

The procedure involved:
- Right femoral artery puncture and placement of an 8 French introducer.
- Angiography to visualize the PVL.
- Placement of a multipurpose catheter and guidewire through the PVL.
- Deployment of the Amplatzer Vascular Plug III to occlude the leak.

The procedure was successful, with immediate post-implantation echocardiography confirming no residual leak. The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure.

**Post-Procedure Course:**
The patient demonstrated clinical improvement and was hemodynamically stable upon recovery. 

**Follow-Up:**
At one-year follow-up, the patient reported no new hospitalizations for heart failure, an improved functional class, and an increase in hemoglobin levels to 11 mg/dL.
