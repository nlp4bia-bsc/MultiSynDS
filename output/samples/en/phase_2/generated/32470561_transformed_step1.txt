**Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**
- Name: [Patient Name]
- Age: 46 years
- Gender: Female
- Admission Date: [Admission Date]
- Discharge Date: [Discharge Date]

**Reason for Admission:**
The patient was admitted due to exacerbation of chronic heart failure with a significantly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≈ 20%), attributed to post-partum cardiomyopathy.

**Clinical Course:**
Upon admission, the patient was stable and had been managed with optimal medical therapy for several years, including the implantation of an automatic cardioverter defibrillator. Right heart catheterization indicated low cardiac output (CO) of 2.57 L/min, elevated left ventricular filling pressures, and signs of fluid congestion. High doses of diuretics were initiated to alleviate congestion.

During the hospital stay, the patient developed fever and was diagnosed with Influenza type A, which resulted in hemodynamic instability. Inotropic and vasopressor support became necessary to maintain adequate circulation. The patient experienced an electrical storm, necessitating resuscitation, intubation, and transfer to the cardiac intensive care unit for advanced management.

In light of critical hemodynamic status and inadequate cardiac output to meet the patient's needs, the decision was made to implant a mechanical support device. Percutaneous femoral access was obtained, and an 18Fr special sheath was inserted over a super stiff wire. The iVAC2L device was then positioned using a contralaterally inserted pigtail catheter to mark the aortic valve position. This technique highlighted the potential for the device to fully submerge in large ventricles, which could impair its function.

Continuous monitoring through a Swan-Ganz catheter demonstrated an increase in cardiac output and cardiac index from 2.5 L/min and 1.2 L/min/m² to 5.2 L/min and 2.5 L/min/m², respectively. The device effectively supported the patient for over 48 hours. 

**Outcome:**
Despite initial improvements, the patient's condition gradually deteriorated, culminating in septic shock. Systemic vascular resistance continued to decline, and the patient ultimately succumbed to her condition.

**Plan:**
- The family has been informed of the patient's condition and the events leading to her demise.
- A follow-up with the cardiology team is recommended for further evaluation of similar cases in the future.
