**Patient Information:**
- Name: [Patient Name]
- Age: 70 years
- Height: 170 cm
- Weight: 48 kg
- ASA Status: IV

**Medical History:**
- Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) due to dilated cardiomyopathy
- Diabetes Mellitus
- Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
- History of right leg weakness due to thrombotic occlusion of the right ilio-femoral artery

**Admission Details:**
- Admission Date: [Admission Date]
- Procedure: Debridement of skin necrosis in the right leg
- Duration of Stay: [Duration of Stay]

**Clinical Findings:**
- Skin necrosis on the anterolateral side of the lower leg
- Initial BNP level: 837 pg/mL (decreased to 216 pg/mL pre-surgery)
- Chest radiography indicated pneumonic infiltration in the right lung and diffuse emphysematous changes in both lungs
- Preoperative echocardiography revealed:
  - Global hypokinesia
  - Severe left ventricular dysfunction (Ejection Fraction: 11%)
  - Enlarged left atrium and ventricular chamber
  - Grade II diastolic dysfunction

**Preoperative Management:**
- Heart failure managed with spironolactone, ivabradine, sacubitril/valsartan, and warfarin (1.5 mg)
- Anticoagulation therapy continued due to high thromboembolism risk
- Blood pressure: Systolic 70 mmHg, Diastolic 40 mmHg
- Coagulation profile: Activated prothrombin time 49.4 s, INR 1.63

**Anesthesia Plan:**
- Regional anesthesia was initially considered but contraindicated due to anticoagulation therapy.
- Patient preferred general anesthesia despite counseling regarding the benefits of regional anesthesia.
- A popliteal sciatic nerve block and fascia iliaca compartment block were performed under ultrasound guidance.

**Surgical Procedure:**
- Surgery was performed successfully with stable hemodynamic parameters.
- No analgesics or rescue blocks were required during the operation.
- Postoperative care included transfer to the intensive care unit for close monitoring.

**Postoperative Course:**
- Hemodynamic stability confirmed; transferred to the general ward the following day.
- Underwent two additional wound debridements and a skin autograft at the defect site, all performed using the same nerve block techniques.
- No postoperative complications such as dyspnea or surgical site pain.

**Discharge Condition:**
- The patient was discharged in stable condition without any symptoms.
