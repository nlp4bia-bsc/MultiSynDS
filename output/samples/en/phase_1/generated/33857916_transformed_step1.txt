- Lymphocyte Count: 0.2 × 10^9/L (N: 1.0–3.0 × 10^9/L)
- Elevated inflammatory markers: CRP 1612.38 nmol/L (N: 0–3.81 nmol/L), Procalcitonin 0.72 μg/L (N: 0.02–0.10 μg/L), LDH 6083.33 nmol/(s•L) (N: 833.33–4033.33 nmol/(s•L)), Ferritin 1.15 nmol/L (N: 0.07–0.90 nmol/L), D-dimer 1194 μg/L DDU (N: ≤ 229 μg/L DDU).
- CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis: Ground-glass opacities in bilateral lower lobes; no fluid collections at sternotomy site.
- Nasopharyngeal PCR: Positive for SARS-CoV-2.

**Hospital Course:**
- Infectious diseases consulted; not eligible for interleukin inhibitors due to immunosuppressive therapy.

- Cultures: Morganella morganii and Enterobacter cloacae from sternal wound; blood cultures positive for Morganella.
- Complications included encephalopathy, respiratory failure requiring intubation, acute kidney injury necessitating hemodialysis, and recurrent infections.
- Sternal wound reconstruction with pectoralis major muscle flaps; MMF discontinued, cyclosporine initiated.
- Developed fungal infection (Rhizopus microsporus) requiring surgical intervention and antifungal therapy.
- Hospital course complicated by multiple infections, septic shock, and ultimately, death on day 175 of hospitalization.
