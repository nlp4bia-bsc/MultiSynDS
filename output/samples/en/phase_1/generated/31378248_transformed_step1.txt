**Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**
- Name: [Patient Name]
- Age: 50 years
- Gender: Male
- Date of Admission: [Admission Date]
- Date of Discharge: [Discharge Date]

**Chief Complaint:**
Progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion and chest discomfort.

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient presented with a 2-week history of dyspnea described as "breathing through a straw," accompanied by chest discomfort while lying flat. He reported a weight gain of 5 kg over the past 3 weeks, increased abdominal girth, and episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. His exercise tolerance declined significantly, from being able to ascend 9 flights of stairs to only tolerating a few steps. He denied any fevers, chills, night sweats, palpitations, lightheadedness, or dizziness, and had no recent upper respiratory symptoms.

**Past Medical History:**
- Congenital ventricular septal defect (VSD)
- Obesity (BMI: 35 kg/mÂ²)
- Seasonal allergies

**Medications:**
- Fexofenadine

**Social History:**
- Non-smoker
- Alcohol intake: 2-3 beverages per week

**Family History:**
- Brother with atrial fibrillation; no family history of heart failure or premature coronary artery disease.

**Physical Examination:**
- Vital Signs: Tachycardic at 148 bpm, irregularly irregular rhythm
- Respiratory: Bibasilar crackles
- Cardiovascular: Jugular venous distension, hepatojugular reflux
- Abdomen: Distended
- Extremities: 1+ symmetric bilateral lower extremity pitting edema

**Diagnostic Studies:**
- **Laboratory Results:**
  - Hemoglobin: 16.0 g/dL
  - Sodium: 143 mmol/L
  - Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
  - Lipid Panel: LDL 77 U/L, HDL 54 mg/dL, Triglycerides 88 mg/dL, Total Cholesterol 137 mg/dL
  - TSH: 2.0 mlU/L

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) at 148 bpm, no ischemic changes.
- **Chest Radiography:** Mild cardiomegaly.
- **Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE):** LVEF 25%, severe left ventricular hypokinesis, moderate right ventricular enlargement, severe left atrial enlargement, functional severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.

**Diagnosis:**
Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) likely due to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.

**Treatment:**
- Initiated on furosemide and metoprolol tartrate for heart failure management.
- Transitioned to carvedilol for beta blockade.
- Started on lisinopril and long-term apixaban for anticoagulation.
- Underwent successful TEE-guided direct cardioversion after unsuccessful attempts with medication.
- Amiodarone was initiated post-cardioversion due to severe left atrial enlargement.

**Follow-Up:**
- Repeated TTE showed improvement in EF to 52% after 2 months, but subsequent decline to 35-40% with recurrent atrial fibrillation episodes.
- Underwent repeat direct current cardioversion, followed by a rhythm control strategy with atrial fibrillation ablative therapy.
- At 6-month follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic with maintained EF of 61%.

**Plan:**
- Continue monitoring cardiac function and adjust medications as necessary.
- Discuss potential long-term effects of amiodarone and consider alternatives if needed.
- Schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor heart failure status and rhythm control.

**Discharge Instructions:**
- Adhere to prescribed medication regimen.
- Monitor weight and report any significant changes.
- Maintain follow-up appointments with cardiology and primary care.
- Educate on signs of worsening heart failure and when to seek medical attention.
