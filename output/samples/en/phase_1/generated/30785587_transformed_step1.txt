**Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**
- **Name:** [Patient Name]
- **Age:** 51 years
- **Gender:** Male
- **Medical History:** Hypertension, former smoker

**Admission Details:**
- **Date of Admission:** [Initial Admission Date]
- **Transfer to Instituto do Coração:** June 14, 2012
- **Reason for Transfer:** Treatment of thoracic aortic dissection and heart failure.

**Clinical Presentation:**
The patient presented with a three-week history of progressively worsening chest pain, dyspnea, sweating, and vomiting. Upon admission, he exhibited high blood pressure and was diagnosed with thoracic aortic dissection. He received antihypertensive and beta-blocker therapy.

**Physical Examination on Admission (June 14, 2012):**
- General health: Good
- Vital signs: Heart rate 80 bpm, Blood pressure 80/60 mmHg
- Jugular venous pressure: Increased
- Cardiac auscultation: Rhythmic heart sounds, ++++ diastolic murmur at left sternal border
- Lungs: Clear
- Abdomen: No alterations
- Lower limbs: No edema, symmetrical pulses

**Laboratory Findings (June 14, 2012):**
- Hemoglobin: 15.9 g/dL
- Hematocrit: 49%
- Leukocytes: 10,080/mm³
- Platelets: 232,000/mm³
- CKMB: 1.33 ng/mL
- Troponin I: 0.106 ng/mL
- Creatinine: 0.94 mg/dL
- Negative serology for hepatitis B, C, and HIV

**Imaging Studies:**
- **ECG (June 16, 2012):** Sinus rhythm, left atrial and left ventricular overload.
- **Echocardiogram (June 17, 2012):** Ejection fraction 22%, ascending aortic dissection observed.
- **Chest X-ray (June 18, 2012):** Normal lung fields, suggestive of aortic aneurysm.

**Surgical Intervention:**
- **Date:** June 19, 2012
- **Procedure:** Repair of ascending aortic dissection with Dacron tube interposition and aortic valve repair.
- **Postoperative Course:** Uncomplicated; discharged on the ninth postoperative day.

**Subsequent Admissions:**
1. **Date:** July 11, 2012
   - **Reason:** Worsening dyspnea due to non-adherence to medication.
   - **Findings:** Blood pressure 80/60 mmHg, heart rate 60 bpm, laboratory tests indicated anemia and elevated BNP.

2. **Date:** August 11, 2012
   - **Reason:** Dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, oliguria.
   - **Findings:** Blood pressure 80/60 mmHg, heart rate 102 bpm, pulmonary congestion on chest X-ray, severe heart failure noted.

**Final Admission:**
- **Date:** August 29, 2012
- **Condition:** Developed refractory shock, required intubation and increased vasopressor support.
- **Laboratory Findings:** Persistent anemia, elevated creatinine, and signs of infection.

**Outcome:**
- The patient remained in shock and passed away on September 4, 2012.

**Clinical Summary:**
The patient presented with ascending aortic dissection and underwent surgical repair. Despite initial recovery, he developed severe heart failure and ultimately succumbed to cardiogenic shock. Contributing factors included chronic hypertension and significant left ventricular dysfunction.

**Anatomopathological Findings:**
- Post-surgical changes consistent with aortic dissection repair.
- Evidence of aortic valve regurgitation and pulmonary infarctions.
- Cause of death: Congestive heart failure with terminal shock.

**Recommendations for Future Care:**
- Close monitoring for patients with a history of aortic dissection and heart failure.
- Consideration of genetic counseling for potential connective tissue disorders in younger patients with aortic aneurysms.
