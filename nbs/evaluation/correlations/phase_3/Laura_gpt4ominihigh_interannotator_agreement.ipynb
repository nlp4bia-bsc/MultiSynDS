      "# Reference Answer\n",
      " A 67‐year‐old man treated with hemodialysis was evaluated for worsening heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF). Eighteen years ago, he experienced an anterior ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD). He was a former smoker and had both diabetes Type 2 and hypercholesterolemia. Ten years ago, he underwent coronary angiography showing progression of coronary artery disease with occlusion of the LAD and the right coronary artery (RCA). Bypass grafting was performed with left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to the LAD and a saphenous vein graft to the RCA. Five years ago, he had a posterolateral STEMI due to a circumflex (CX) occlusion, treated by PCI of the proximal CX and marginal branch. The STEMI was complicated by an acute pulmonary edema and hypotension. The left ventricular (LV) function was severely depressed with an EF 34% and high filling pressures. At that moment, a mild to moderate renal impairment was present with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 52 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Heart failure treatment was optimized, but due to hypotension, only a moderate dose of bisoprolol (5 mg) and ramipril (5 mg) was tolerated. He received both bumetanide and spironolactone. Despite optimal medical therapy, he was several times hospitalized because of decompensated heart failure. An implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator (ICD) was implanted 4 months after the posterolateral STEMI. There was no indication for biventricular pacing because the QRS complex was not enlarged. At that time, the renal function was moderately depressed with an eGFR of 40 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Because of NYHA Class 3 heart failure with VO2max of only 9 ml/kg/min on maximal ergospirometry, he was considered but not accepted as a candidate for heart transplantation. Four years ago, he was randomized in the sham controlled CHART‐1 clinical trial investigating intramyocardial stem cell injection.3 During the study period, there were no hospitalizations for heart failure, and after completion and unblinding, he was informed that he had received active treatment. Two years ago, there was a new series of hospitalizations for heart failure with progressive decline of the renal function. Because of poor diabetic control, he was treated with insulin. Peritoneal dialysis was started 2 years ago but was abandoned because of several episodes of peritonitis. Since 1 year, he is treated with hemodialysis. Despite low blood pressure especially during dialysis, he still received 80 mg of valsartan, 3.75 mg of bisoprolol, and 50 mg of spironolactone. The cardiac function was severely depressed with EF 35% but with chronically high filling pressures, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and moderate functional mitral regurgitation (MR) with effective regurgitant orifice of 23 mm2 and a regurgitant volume of 27 ml, considered not sufficient for a mitraclip. After a new episode of worsening heart failure 6 months ago, he underwent a new heart catheterization and coronary angiography showing patent grafts and moderate in stent restenosis of the CX with preserved fraction flow reserve (FFR) and no indication for revascularization. There was severe postcapillary pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure 40 mmHg) and an elevated wedge pressure of 29 mmHg. The heart rate was 62, he was not considered a good candidate for ivabradine. Because there were no other treatment possibilities, we started a treatment with sacubitril/valsartan. The drug was started on a nondialysis day with a blood pressure of 97/56 mmHg. NT‐proBNP at that time was 11 400 pg/mL. He tolerated the starting dose of 24/26 mg sacubitril/valsartan twice a day, also on dialysis days. After 4 weeks at a follow‐up consultation, the blood pressure was 105/60 mmHg, and the dose was increased to 49/51 mg twice a day, both on nondialysis and dialysis days. He described a symptomatic improvement and started again to leave the house for a small walk. The functional class improved from NYHA 3 to NYHA 2. Functional testing with 6‐min walk test was performed before the start of treatment with a walking distance of 300 m. Because of the development of a diabetic foot ulcer, the test could not be repeated. Filling pressures estimated by echocardiography decreased after the initiation of sacubitril/valsartan (Table ​1)1) without changing the intensity of ultrafiltration. There was also a reduction in function mitral insufficiency. Three months after initiation of sacubitril/valsartan, the NT‐proBNP value was reduced to 5,960 pg/ml. Until now, 6 months after the initiation of sacubitril/valsartan, there were no episodes of worsening heart failure.\n",

      "# Reference Answer\n",
      " GSA, male, 55 years old, white, forklift operator, natural and from the state of São Paulo, was referred to the office reporting dyspnea on efforts with progressive worsening in the last two months, asthenia, inappetence and weight loss. He reported periods of night sweats but denied a fever. He referred to hypothyroidism and dyslipidemia on treatment with levothyroxine sodium and simvastatin. Physical examination was afebrile, eupneic and with mild jugular stasis. In the chest examination no adventitious noises were observed in the pulmonary auscultation and, in cardiac auscultation, the rhythm was irregular, without murmurs and the sounds were normal. No paradoxical pulse was observed. In the examination of the abdomen there was discrete hepatomegaly without other changes. Biochemical tests were normal, serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was negative, and the search for alcohol-acid-resistant bacilli in the sputum was negative. On the electrocardiogram, atrial fibrillation was evidenced. In the simple chest radiographs, there was extensive pericardial calcification involving right ventricular chamber and right atrial chamber. In the color doppler echocardiogram it was observed the presence of echogenic image prior to the right atrium and ventricle, mainly restricting the mobility and contractility of the basal mean portion of the ventricular chamber; asynchronous movement of the whole right ventricle and interventricular septum compromising the systolic-diastolic function of this chamber; dilated hepatic veins and inferior vena cava with variation of expandability reduced to the maneuvers and impairment of left ventricular systolic function. Magnetic resonance of the thorax revealed signs of pericardial thickening with surrounding calcifications, with the largest thickness, about 3 cm, in the anterior and lower anterior pericardial walls. The hemodynamic study showed significant diffuse pericardial calcification and absence of obstructive coronariopathy. With these findings, pericardiectomy was indicated. Access to the thoracic cavity was by median sternotomy, after which a distended pericardium was seen in the lower third. The opening immediately exposed a large volume of a doughy material of dark brown color and necrotic appearance (caseous necrosis). A great amount of this collection was promptly removed from below the diaphragmatic wall of the right ventricle where it had been exerting a great compressive effect. During surgery, a large volume of calcium was found in the pericardium, most of which strongly adhered to the right chambers, compressing the right ventricle, particularly. Careful removal of the thickened pericardium and calcium was required, and in view of the hemodynamic instability, the risk of cardiac perforation and the posterior extension of pericarditis, the use of extracorporeal circulation was chosen. Extracorporeal circulation was then established by drainage of both vena cava and arterial infusion through the ascending aorta. Under total aortic clamping and cardioplegic arrest, with Custodiol®, excision of the thickened pericardium and calcium were performed, which extended posteriorly until the pulmonary veins’ debouchment. After complete removal of pericardium, calcium, and caseous necrosis, the heart was fully released. Extracorporeal circulation was then discontinued, with the help of inotropic drugs, as soon as the hemodynamic conditions allowed. The surgery was completed with revision of hemostasis, mediastinal and retrocardiac drainage and finally closure of the thorax. Patient remained under intensive care unit for 5 days, a longer period than usual, necessary for weaning vasoactive drugs and readaptation to the new hemodynamic picture. An anatomopathological study revealed chronic non-specific pericarditis with diffuse hyalinized fibrosis, vascular neoformation and extensive dystrophic calcification. The culture was negative for the presence of alcohol-acid-resistant bacilli. The patient presented a good evolution and was discharged from hospital to resume his daily life. The Doppler echocardiogram before hospital discharge revealed a significant improvement with biventricular normofunction. Despite the fact that the tests did not detect tuberculosis, due to the strongly suggestive clinical picture, antituberculosis (Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Pirazinamide) was started in the first phase and (Rifampicin, Isoniazid) in the second phase.\n",

      " Patient information\n",
      "A woman in her 70s diagnosed with HF in 1999, having comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, hypertension, diabetes and kidney failure (stage 4). The patient lived with a full-time carer, in one of the most deprived (decile 1 for both the Index of Multiple Deprivation and the Health Deprivation and Disability Domain) areas of England. As per usual practice, the patient was mostly looked after by her general practitioner (GP).\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient and her son provided informed consent to use her anonymised data for research purposes. The patient’s son consented to the access and use of the patient’s medical records after she had passed away. The data were collected as part of post-market surveillance activities in the UK.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment\n",
      "Device information\n",
      "The Heartfelt device (Heartfelt Technologies) and connected weighing scales (Xiaomi Smart Scales, Anhui Huami Information Technologies) were installed in the patient’s home and connected via the internet to cloud-based servers for continuous monitoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Heartfelt device is an automated, non-invasive, remote volume-monitoring system that uses 3D sensors to automatically measure the volume of the foot/lower leg and generates alerts when the foot volume increases. In a hospital study, the volumes measured using the Heartfelt device were compared with volumes measured using water displacement (gold standard to measure foot volume) and the Heartfelt device had a SE of measurement of ±12.6 mL.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 3D sensor captures images at a rate of 30 images per second, which are censored at knee height. Measurements are then processed using artificial intelligence in cloud servers. A selection of 4–8 3D images are used to calculate the volume, these images may have been captured over a period of a few minutes or hours depending on the patient’s routine in the room where the device is located. When an increase in volume is detected beyond baseline level (oedema), an alert is generated. The alert can be sent to the patient, their carer or their clinical team. The innovation of the Heartfelt device is that it requires no specific action from the patient unlike other telemonitoring technologies that require patients to interact or comply with instructions for use. Even weighing scales, which are used as part of standard care for the management of HF, require a level of compliance from patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Timeline\n",
      "The Heartfelt device was installed in the patient’s house at a location and height to allow for optimal data collection and it successfully collected and transmitted data for fifteen months (November 2018 to January 2020; until the patient’s first hospital admission. A few more days of data were collected between discharge and the second admission. 3D images of feet/lower legs of the patient were automatically captured, censored, encrypted and transmitted securely over the internet to cloud-based servers for final processing to generate daily foot/lower leg volumes. These daily data points were monitored by trained operators and our setup ensured that no change was required in the patient’s lifestyle or standard care and she could be monitored safely in her home.\n",
      "\n",
      "First alert\n",
      "Following an increase in lower limb volume starting in late December 2019, an alert was raised on third Jan 2020 and the patient and her carer were informed as per the agreed contact method with the patient and her family at the time of installation. A follow-up alert was generated on 11 January 2020 and the patient was visited by a GP on 12 January 2020 on patient’s request, at which point peripheral oedema was confirmed up to the knee. Given that the patient had kidney failure and was on the maximal tolerated dose of oral diuretic (120 mg furosemide/day and 50 mg/day spironolactone), the ongoing medications were kept the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "First hospitalisation\n",
      "For the next few days, the patient’s condition did not improve and the GP was called for a home visit again. Peripheral oedema was noted as thigh-high and ascites, and the patient also suffered severe shortness of breath after five steps. The GP and patient agreed that the best course of action would be to get IV diuretic to help reduce congestion. In the patient’s area, this can only be done through an admission. Therefore the GP planned for the patient to be admitted on 16 January 2020. The patient was admitted as a non-urgent admission to a cardiology ward and HF decompensation was subsequently confirmed. The patient remained hospitalised and was discharged on 7 February 2020 with further treatment of high-dose diuretics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second alert\n",
      "The system logged measurements following discharge, which indicated the patient was not euvolaemic and her feet were still swollen. The patient was then bedbound for several days, and on 12 February 2020 a further measurement with >300 mL increase was made, and the patient was informed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second hospitalisation\n",
      "After the second alert, the condition of the patient deteriorated rapidly. New diuretics were prescribed by her GP, 5 mg amiloride and 2.5 mg metolazone and furosemide was reduced to 160 mg/day. She was then admitted to hospital again on 15 February 2020 as a non-urgent admission. The patient remained in hospital until the 23 February 2020 and began to receive palliative care from 24 February 2020 onwards. The patient subsequently died on 8 March 2020.\n",

      "Follow-up and outcomes\n",
      "The volume trends and alerts generated throughout the 15 months for the patient. Alerts were generated both times in a timely fashion to prevent the need for an emergency hospital admission.

      " A 54-year-old male had had a HeartMate 3™ implanted in a prepericardiac location due to end-stage congestive heart failure. The patient underwent invasive investigation of the system a year later to confirm its actual clinical necessity. A 6-Fr pig-tail catheter was placed in the left ventricular cavity at its apex site, near the location of the surgically inserted device’s outflow. A ventriculography of the left heart was performed. The wall motion analysis indicated a severely enlarged left ventricle (LV), with significantly impaired systolic function (LVEDV = 278 mL, LVESV = 239 mL, LVEF% = 14%). It also clearly revealed a 2-cm-long conduit, i.e. half the length of its counterpart from previous HeartMate™ generations. The conduit was surgically implanted through the apex site into the LV cavity, facing the mitral inflow directly, and allowing the entire output delivered to the LV from the pulmonary circulation to be pumped through the device with its maximal output of 10 L/min. A second ventriculography, done in the left lateral and cranial view, clearly documented the compact arrangement of the inflow and outflow sites of the HeartMate 3™. Interestingly, the outflow part was located outside the cardiac structure and was connected to the aorta with a Dacron graft of 12 mm Ø. It was clearly visualised that the contrast medium, after being injected into the left ventricular cavity, flowed through the conduit into the device chamber, where the blades of the spinning rotor ejected the blood volume in a pulsating manner into the Dacron graft. Then, a 6-Fr pig-tail catheter was positioned inside the lumen of the Dacron graft, near the site of its connection with the device’s outflow. Subsequently performed angiography showed that the graft securely connected the device chamber with the ascending aorta, and that it was of uniform 12.0-mm dimeter along its entire length with an unobstructed graft-aorta anastomosis. The system controller was located outside the thorax and connected to the pump through a cable, allowing for power supplementation and direct control of the device’s functions.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Clinical History:**\n",
      "The patient has a history of idiopathic biventricular dilated cardiomyopathy and was placed on the heart transplantation waiting list four years prior to this admission. He underwent LVAD implantation two years ago due to worsening heart failure and cardiogenic shock. Postoperatively, he experienced complications including pump thrombosis, transient stroke, and mild pancreatitis. He was managed with anticoagulation and antihypertensive medications. Over the following year, he had episodes of brain hemorrhage and kidney decompensation, which were controlled with diuretics.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Present Admission:**\n",
      "The patient was admitted 18 months post-LVAD implantation with suspected acute appendicitis. Upon admission, he exhibited altered general status, abdominal pain, headache, dyspnea, and fatigue. He was conscious and cooperative, with mild peripheral edema and elevated blood pressure (100 mmHg). His medication regimen included Enalapril, Carvedilol, Aspirin, Acenocoumarol, Furosemide, and Omeprazole.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Laboratory Findings:**\n",
      "- Renal function: Creatinine 1.13 mg/dL, Creatinine clearance 98 mL/min\n",
      "- Mild hyperuricemia: Uric acid 9.81 mg/dL\n",
      "- Normal liver enzymes and bilirubin levels\n",
      "- INR: 5.4 (poorly controlled anticoagulation)\n",
      "- Hemoglobin: 8.6 g/dL\n",
      "\n",
      "During hospitalization, renal function deteriorated, leading to multiple organ failure syndrome (MOFS). Hematological parameters indicated worsening renal failure, with creatinine rising to 9.02 mg/dL and uremia at 235 mg/dL. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Imaging Studies:**\n",
      "- Chest X-ray: Dilated heart, LVAD in place, no lung modifications\n",
      "- Echocardiography: Severe LV dilatation, EF 10%, right heart failure\n",
      "- Abdominal ultrasound: Hepatosplenomegaly, enlarged kidneys\n",
      "- CT scan: No acute lesions but evidence of previous strokes\n",
      "\n",
      "**Diagnosis:**\n",
      "Decompensated right heart failure with poorly controlled anticoagulation in a patient with LVAD.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Therapeutic Interventions:**\n",
      "The patient was treated with Amlodipine to manage blood pressure, and anticoagulation was adjusted. Despite initial improvement, the patient's condition deteriorated, leading to episodes of hemoptysis, worsening peripheral edema, and progressive renal failure. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) was initiated, but the patient ultimately succumbed to fatal cerebral hemorrhage three months after admission.\n",

      " Clinical history\n",
      "\n",
      "Four years before the admission described in this paper, a 13-year-old male patient, known to have idiopathic biventricular dilated cardiomyopathy, was registered in our Emergency Institute for Cardiovascular Diseases and Transplantation. He was included on the waiting list for heart transplantation. After two years, his condition worsened and presented the clinical picture of cardiogenic shock. At that time, he was urgently hospitalized, intubated and ventilated, with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) back-up. As the creatinine level was slightly elevated, he also needed renal support. A cf-LVAD was implanted at another clinic.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the early postoperative phase, the pump’s power consumption increased. This was an indicator of possible pump thrombosis. Unfractionated heparin and systemic thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was carried out. As the pump function did not improve, it was replaced with another pump six days after LVAD implantation. After another two weeks, a transient stroke and mild pancreatitis were diagnosed, without significant complications. In the early and late postoperative days, several bleeding episodes occurred, one with cardiac tamponade, which required reintervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "During hospitalization, the patient presented with a fever (38°C) and elevated serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP >200 mg/dL; normal range <5 mg/dL). As a sputum culture was positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae and coliform bacilli, Meropenem and Vancomycin were administrated with good results.\n",
      "\n",
      "After obtaining normal LVAD function, progressively increasing systemic blood pressure required the long-term administration of Enalapril 20 mg bis in die (BID – twice a day) and Bisoprolol 5 mg quaque die (QD – once a day). As renal function improved after the LVAD implant, there was no need for diuretics at discharge.\n",
      "\n",
      "No other significant or uncontrolled events occurred in the first year. At 12 months after the LVAD implant, the patient suffered two episodes of brain hemorrhage, for which he was hospitalized and operated on twice in the Clinic of Neurosurgery, without sequelae. In the following six months, he had another three small hemorrhagic strokes causing hemianopsia, without motor deficit. He also showed repeated episodes of kidney decompensation, with serum creatinine levels up to 2.7 mg% (normal ranges 0.6–1.2 mg%). This was kept under control with diuretics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient neglected to have properly monitored coagulation parameters in the ambulatory and did not regularly control the blood pressure values.\n",
      "\n",
      "Present admission\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinical findings\n",
      "\n",
      "At 18 months after LVAD implant, the 17-year-old normosthenic male was hospitalized with the suspicion of acute appendicitis. We noted altered general status, intense abdominal pain, headache, dyspnea, and fatigue after limited physical effort. On admission, the patient was conscious, partially cooperative and without fever. Cardio-respiratory function was checked: pump sound was detected with cardiac auscultation, there was no palpable peripheral pulse, mild peripheral edema, no pulmonary crackles. The medium systolic blood pressure was 100 mmHg. On palpation of the abdomen, there was no muscular defense, but the liver was enlarged.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient was undergoing therapy with anti-hypertensive medication, which included an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (Enalapril 20 mg BID) and alpha–beta blocker (Carvedilol 12.5 mg BID). Long-term treatment with an antiaggregant (Aspirin 100 mg QD), an anticoagulant [Acenocoumarol QD for international normalized ratio (INR) 2–3], a diuretic (Furosemide 40 mg QD) and a proton pump inhibitor (Omeprazole 20 mg BID), was also declared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laboratory examinations\n",
      "\n",
      "On admission, the hematological and serum biochemical analyses showed a compensated renal function (creatinine – 1.13 mg/dL, creatinine clearance – 98 mL/min, urea – 36.8 mg%), with mild elevated uric acid (9.81 mg%, with normal ranges of 3.5–7.2 mg/dL). Liver enzymes were within normal ranges, with serum glutamic–oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) of 9 IU/L (normal ranges 5–34 IU/L) and glutamate–pyruvate transaminase (GPT) of 6 IU/L (normal value <55 IU/L), same as the value of total bilirubin (0.47 mg/dL).\n",
      "\n",
      "A slightly high level of serum procalcitonin (1 ng/mL, with normal range <0.5 ng/mL), and a normal value of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), respectively 110 mg/dL, were also reported. An acute infection was dismissed by normal serum level of CRP (5 mg/dL) and total leukocytes, which were 6000/μL (normal values 3600–10 000/μL) [6].\n",
      "\n",
      "Coagulation parameters showed a poorly controlled risk of hemorrhage, with an INR value of 5.4, under anti-coagulant treatment (reference for INR: 2–3). This was associated with normal platelets (275 000/μL; normal range 150 000–450 000/μL) and low hemoglobin values (8.6 g/dL; normal ranges 11–17 g/dL).\n",
      "\n",
      "During hospitalization, the laboratory examinations indicated the progressive development of multiple organ failure syndrome (MOFS). Two weeks after admission, renal failure was proved by the following parameters: high creatinine (9.02 mg%); low creatinine clearance (10 mL/min; normal reference ranges 107–139 mL/min); uremia (235 mg%); hypoproteinemia (plasma proteins: 5 g/dL; normal values 6.4–8.3 g/dL); low plasma albumin (2.2 g/dL; normal values 3.5–5.2 g/dL); high uric acid (17.66 mg%). Liver enzymes were kept within normal ranges (GOT – 23 IU/L, GPT – 17 IU/L), with progressively increasing total bilirubin (2.02 mg/dL) and LDH (222 mg/dL) and normal values of leukocytes (9120/μL). Hemoglobin decreased to 6.8 g/L.\n",
      "\n",
      "The urine test detected hematuria, proteinuria and leukocyturia, without detection of nitrites, bilirubin, or urobilinogen and without modification of the urine density (1.025; normal values 1.005–1.030).\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagistic investigations\n",
      "\n",
      "On admission, chest X-rays showed no modifications of the lungs, a dilated heart and the LVAD in the apex of the LV. An electrocardiogram revealed left fascicular hemiblock and right bundle branch block, with a heart rate of 80 beats/min (bpm). The echocardiography showed dilatation of all ventricular and atrial cavities, with decreased ejection fraction (EF) of the LV at 10% (normal value >60%). Moderate hypokinetic right ventricle, mitral and tricuspid regurgitation was diagnosed, with properly working inflow cannula at the apex of the LV.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abdominal ultrasound examination detected hepatosplenomegaly and enlarged kidneys, with increased echogenicity of the renal cortex. A pseudonodular lesion was described at the lower splenic pole, without enlargement of the appendix. In the first days, the computed tomography (CT) examination of the cranial cavity did not show acute parenchymatous lesions but confirmed the patient’s history of repeated strokes. Through the 38/33 mm (centro-central/latero-lateral) right parietal craniotomy orifice, minimal extracranial herniation of the brain tissue was obvious. Hypodense lesion located at the level of the left lentiform nucleus and at the body of the left caudate nucleus, was suggestive of a healed ischemic stroke, with associated porencephalia.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the three months of hospitalization, CT scans performed during the seizures revealed new hemorrhagic outbreaks. In the last stages, chest X-ray showed diffuse veiling of both lung areas, which were treated as a bronchopneumonia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diagnosis, therapy, and evolution\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on clinical and paraclinical examinations, the case was interpreted on admission as decompensated right heart failure with poor control of anticoagulation parameters in a patient with an LVAD implant.\n",
      "\n",
      "To prevent stroke and pump thrombosis in patients with LVAD implants, the systolic blood pressure should be maintained at a mean value of 70–80 mmHg. To achieve this, it was necessary to add the calcium blocker Amlodipine (10 mg QD) to the ACE inhibitor and alpha–beta blocker. The INR values were controlled with anticoagulants. Persistent headache with episodes of seizures and increased intracranial pressure were treated with osmotic diuretics (Mannitol) and neuroprotectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although an initial improvement was obtained, it was followed by the gradual deterioration of the general condition of the patient, with increased intensity of the headache. Hepato-renal failure occurred at two weeks after admission, followed by episodes of hemoptysis and worsening of peripheral edema. Blood pressure progressively collapsed, with gradual reduction of diuresis, up to 500 mL/day, and positive inotropic treatment with Dobutamine was needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The LVAD controller indicated low flow alarms. The repeated echocardiography revealed significant dilatation of the ventricular and atrial cavities, with worsening of the right heart failure. Antibiotics, hepatoprotectives, gastroprotectives and analgesics, at progressively increasing doses, completed diuretic treatment on continuous infusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the final stage, MOFS occurred. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) was initiated but, after 48 hours, the fatal cerebral hemorrhage was diagnosed. Death occurred three months after the final admission, 21 months after the LVAD implant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Autopsy findings\n",
      "\n",
      "The trephination orifices in the skull, which were performed over six months before the final admission, were identified in the occipital and temporal areas, with mild brain herniation. In the edematous brain parenchyma, reactive gliosis was confirmed under the microscope, as corresponding to these orifices. In the fronto-parietal area, multiple foci of parenchymatous hemorrhages were observed, the largest hematoma being 65×45 mm, which exerted mass effect over the median line. Multiple diapedesis hemorrhages were also seen (Figure ​(Figure1,1, D and E).\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the heart, the LVAD from the apex of the LV did not associate signs of thrombosis or dehiscence. Iatrogenic pericardial adherences were identified. The heart weight was 882 g, with dilatation of the cavities, causing secondary mitral and tricuspid insufficiency. No coronarosclerosis or thrombosis of the coronary arteries was observed. Histological findings consisted of marked fibrosis of the myocardium, along with a focus of septic abscess located at the level of the anterior wall of the LV.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examination of the lungs and respiratory tract revealed bilateral dystelectasia, which was clearly visible on the background of a brown parenchyma. Under the microscope, disseminated hemorrhages, with siderophages inside the alveolar spaces, which were colored in blue with Perls Prussian Blue staining, were admixed with neutrophils. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was proved by the presence of focal hyaline membranes upon alveolar septa, as indicators of shock lung.\n",
      "\n",
      "Centrilobular liver necrosis suggested the diagnosis of shock liver. The 380 g spleen showed, on the cut section, a 40×20×10 mm triangular, yellowish area, which was confirmed under the microscope as a superinfected splenic infarction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The enlarged kidneys (left – 380 g; right – 355 g) showed, on cut section, changes compatible with a diagnosis of shock kidney, i.e., medullary hyperemia and a pale, ischemic renal cortex. Microscopic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of shock kidney. Routine Hematoxylin–Eosin (HE) staining also revealed extensive glomerular changes, which consisted of an enlarged mesangial area, with focal glomerular sclerosis, highlighted in green with Masson’s trichrome staining. Crescentic proliferation of parietal cells of Bowman’s capsule was observed, without neutrophils. Interstitial nephritis was also documented.\n",
      "\n",
      "In paraffin-embedded kidney parenchyma tissue, IHC stainings were also performed. We used the cell–cell adhesion marker cluster of differentiation (CD) 44 (Dako©, Denmark, 1:50 dilution, sodium citrate pH 6 retrieval), Wilms’ tumor 1 (WT1) protein antibody (Dako©, Denmark, ready-to-use, high pH retrieval) and the stem cells-related markers CD133 (Millipore©, Denmark, 1:50 dilution, high pH retrieval) and octamer-binding transcription factor-3/4 (Oct-3/4) (Leica©, UK, 1:50 dilution, high pH retrieval). In the affected glomeruli, CD44 proved to mark the proliferated parietal cells, while WT1 positivity was clearly seen in the remnant podocytes and the mesangial cells. No positivity for CD133 or Oct-3/4 was highlighted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the above-mentioned autopsy findings, renal failure was explained by a mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis with extracapillary crescents and segmental glomerulosclerosis. Repeated hemorrhagic episodes, associated with terminal hemorrhagic pneumonia, also contributed to progressive degradation of the general status.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      " The patient was a 29-year-old man with PIK3CA c.3140A>G (H1047R) mutation (11% mosaicism). He presented left leg hypertrophy, scoliosis, multiple naevi, and extremely severe vascular malformations. He had previously undergone multiple tumour debulking surgeries and angiographies. He became paraplegic at the age of 20 owing to spinal cord compression and required bladder stenting. He developed progressively worsening, drug-resistant, severe systolic heart failure with a measured cardiac output of 18 l min−1 m−2 (normal < 3.5 l min−1 m−2). Consistently, the brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level was over 2,500 pg ml−1 (normal < 100 pg ml−1). Over five years, the patient received different doses of rapamycin22 to limit vascular tumour growth progression, but this had no overt effects on his abdominal and dorsal vascular tumours. Finally, the patient developed kidney dysfunction with severe proteinuria. A kidney biopsy revealed glomerular lesions with extensive fibrosis. Such lesions may be the result of heart dysfunction, the administration of rapamycin5,8, and/or PIK3CA mutations in the kidney epithelial cells. CT scan and MRI analyses showed severe vascular malformations, while positron emission tomography (PET) scan analysis was negative. Karnofsky and Eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) scores, which indicate general health status23,24, were 20% and 4, respectively. Owing to the severity of the case and poor prognosis, the physicians, surgeons, and radiologists decided to stop any interventional treatment and to provide the patient with only supportive and palliative care. His estimated life expectancy was less than a few months. One month after rapamycin washout, daily oral BYL719 was started at 250 mg per day, the lowest dose used in clinical trials. We observed a rapid improvement in the general status of the patient, as well as a progressive reduction in tumour size, venous dilations and skin lesions. He lost 25 kg in 18 months due to oedema clearance but also to a major reduction in vascular tumour abnormalities. His thorax and abdomen circumferences were reduced by 25% and 39%, respectively, over 18 months. CT scan and MRI analyses confirmed global vascular tumour shrinkage (72% volume decrease at 18 months), as well as disappearance of subcutaneous infiltration. The effect of the drug on heart function was remarkable, with complete correction of BNP levels within 4 weeks. Cardiac output decreased to 3 l min−1 m−2, and his heart size reduced by 25%. The left ventricular mass index to body surface area decreased from 250 g m−2 to 148 g m−2. Renal function also improved rapidly, with estimated glomerular filtration rate increasing from 33 to 52 ml min−1 per 1.73 m2. The hypertrophy of the left leg was also reduced. We observed a marked improvement in skin hypertrophy, with a change in nevus coloration and a reduction in ear size. Finally, after 6 months of BYL719 treatment, the patient began to partially gain bladder function, with an improvement in saddle anaesthesia. MRI revealed a 60% reduction in the size of the venous malformation that was compressing his spinal cord. The patient’s Karnofsky and ECOG scores increased to 80% and 1, respectively. After eighteen months of treatment, the patient had no side effects except hyperglycaemia which was well controlled with nutrition therapy. BYL719 leads to peripheral insulin resistance11 and hyperglycaemia was one of the most common drug-related adverse events in the phase I trial12. The patient is currently still under BYL719 treatment.\n",

      " Our case patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy, on HeartMate II (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) LVAD as destination therapy, hypertension, atrial flutter, and ischemic stroke who presented with a 4-day history of fever, cough, and shortness of breath after recent 2-month travel to Egypt. Initial physical examination revealed a body temperature of 100.9°F (38.3°C), normal mean arterial pressure by Doppler, and oxygen saturation of 70% on room air. Arterial blood gas revealed a partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood of 46 mm Hg despite delivery of 100% fraction of inspired oxygen via nonrebreather ventilation. LVAD parameters were stable on presentation. A chest radiograph showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates suggestive of multifocal pneumonia. The patient seemed to be in moderate respiratory distress, with tachypnea and accessory muscle use. Owing to concern for developing respiratory muscle fatigue and impending respiratory failure, the decision was made to pursue intubation and mechanical ventilation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Testing for novel coronavirus returned positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction. Salient features of the patient's initial clinical laboratory trend include lymphocytopenia, transaminitis, and hyperbilirubinemia, as well as elevated creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, d-dimer, and ferritin levels. In the following days, the patient developed progressive hypotension requiring initiation of vasopressor agents, acute oliguric renal failure requiring continuous renal replacement therapy, and refractory hypoxemia consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n",
      "\n",
      "Right ventricular failure was considered as a potential etiology of hypotension in the setting of LVAD and inflammatory surge. The patient was unable to be transferred to the catheterization laboratory for invasive hemodynamic assessment owing to COVID-19. Pulmonary artery catheterization was attempted at the bedside, but placement was unsuccessful. A central line was used to measure central venous pressure (17 mm Hg) and oxygen saturation (central venous oxygen saturation of 75%). Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed baseline moderate right ventricular dysfunction. LVAD parameters otherwise remained stable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Management of ARDS was further complicated by refractory hypoxemia despite mechanical ventilation. Implementation of prone positioning was considered to assist with oxygenation; however, the presence of LVAD was determined to be a relative contraindication. Although it has previously been shown that prone positioning unloads the right ventricle in ARDS owing to improved pulmonary pressures,1 the use of this maneuver in the setting of LVAD has not been well-described and may be adversely associated with increase in right ventricular pressures and subsequent right ventricular failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient's clinical course was later complicated by septic shock in the setting of Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus species bacteremia, hyperbilirubinemia secondary to acalculous cholecystitis with requirement for percutaneous cholecystostomy, and acute blood loss anemia secondary to gastrointestinal bleed requiring blood transfusion. Owing to prolonged ventilator-dependent respiratory failure, the patient underwent placement of tracheostomy.\n",

      " A 73‐year‐old female patient was hospitalized with severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis for elective aortic valve replacement (EuroSCORE II: 0.84%). Preoperative workup showed no coronary artery disease. In the preoperative TAVI‐CT (ECG triggered), the distance from the annulus to the left and the right coronary ostia was 14.4 and 15.5 mm, respectively. The dimensions of the aortic valve were a perimeter derived diameter of 23.7 mm, an area of 409.4 mm2, and a perimeter of 74.5 mm. Since the patient had been suffering from perinatal brain injury and symptomatic epilepsy, our heart team decided in favour of a transfemoral TAVI approach (Portico 27 mm, PRT 27 mm, Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, USA). After single post‐dilatation, weaning from elevated noradrenaline support was infeasible and a left bundle branch block and increased central venous pressure (CVP) were observed. The peri‐interventional coronary angiogram revealed an occluded ostium of the right coronary artery (right coronary dominance). The aortic valve prosthesis was not oversized, but a heavily calcified leaflet occluded the right ostium, which could not be intubated. Therefore, the patient was transferred to the operating theatre and underwent uneventful off‐pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with in situ right internal mammary artery (flow 79 mL/min, pulsatility index 0.9). Post‐operative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed moderately to severely reduced right ventricular (RV) function with septal and inferior hypokinesia. At the intensive care unit (ICU), the patient developed RHF with severely reduced function (Table 1) with repeated ventricular fibrillation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation despite extensive catecholamine support (norepinephrine 16 γ/min, milrinon 600 micrograms/h). Therefore, an Impella RP® was implanted under X‐ray guidance by our cardiologists on the ICU, which re‐established hemodynamic stability (cardiac index before Impella: 1.0 L/min/m2, after weaning: 3.7 L/min/m2), and norepinephrine support was reduced to 10 γ/min. The arterial lactate (before Impella: 11.6 mmol/L, at weaning: 0.6 mmol/L) and the central venous pressure (before Impella: 21 mmHg, after weaning: 14 mmHg) were also reduced. Lactate dehydrogenase levels (1413 U/L) peaked on the second and high sensitive troponin‐T levels (9128 ng/L) on the third day after implantation. Weaning from Impella RP® was successful on the fourth post‐operative day. The patient was transferred from the ICU to the ward on the seventh post‐operative day, and the RV function was already fully restored in echocardiography on the thirteenth post‐operative day (Table 1). At the 6 month follow‐up, the RV function was still preserved and the aortic bioprosthesis showed normal function in echocardiography.\n",

      " A 20-year-old man (height: 138 cm, weight: 39 kg) diagnosed with DMD at age 11 was hospitalized for heart failure and dyspnea due to DCM and ischemic cardiomyopathy. He had a history of atrial flutter and underwent left proximal circumflex artery balloon angioplasty for acute embolic myocardial infarction 1 year ago. Despite volume reduction and inotrope use (dobutamine, 3 mcg/kg/min), his blood pressure was maintained at 85–100/55–60 mmHg, and ejection fraction was 24%. He had INTERMACS level 3 DCM. HeartMate 3 LVAD (St Jude Medical Inc., St Paul, MN) implantation was planned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Preoperatively, his B-type natriuretic peptide level was 3803 pg/ml, and sinus rhythm was maintained. Chest radiography showed cardiomegaly and lumbar scoliosis. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed left ventricular (LV) apex, basal anterior wall, and mid to basal posterolateral wall akinesia with severe LV systolic dysfunction. Pulmonary function test results showed a severe restrictive pattern with forced vital capacity of 0.75 L (26% of predicted value). The patient was unable to ambulate, and difficult intubation was anticipated due to postural abnormalities (short neck, small chin, and severe scoliosis). The cardiologist, thoracic surgeon, physiatrist, and anesthesiologist emphasized the importance of postoperative respiratory function recovery, and a pulmonary rehabilitation program was conducted preoperatively to allow early extubation postoperatively. Thoracic expansion exercise, air stacking exercise with manual resuscitation bag (Ambu. bag; Hudson respiratory care Inc., Temecula, CA, USA) and manually assisted cough technique were performed for pulmonary rehabilitation program. High-frequency chest wall oscillation (The Vest® Airway Clearance System, Model 105, Hillrom, USA) and mechanical insufflation–exsufflation device (CoughAssist T70, Philips) were also applied for pulmonary hygiene. Unfortunately, only tiny objective improvement of respiratory function (forced vital capacity of 0.77 L, 27% of predicted value) was confirmed (forced vital capacity of 0.75 L (26% of predicted value).\n",

      "Immediately preoperatively, the patient’s blood pressure was 83/60 mmHg, heart rate was 108 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation was 100% on room air. Total intravenous anesthesia with 2% propofol and 0.05% remifentanil was performed considering the risk of malignant hyperthermia. Video laryngoscopy was performed, because difficult intubation was expected. After continuous infusion of propofol (4 mcg/ml) and remifentanil (3 ng/ml) for 5 min, and bolus injection of 40 mg rocuronium, intubation was successfully performed. Blood pressure was maintained at 80–100/40–60 mmHg using dobutamine (10 mcg/kg/min) and norepinephrine (0.1 mcg/kg/min). A target-controlled infusion pump infused propofol (2–2.5 mcg/ml) and remifentanil (1–2 ng/ml) (bispectral index value 40–60). Rocuronium (2 mcg/kg/min) was continuously infused. Initially, regional cerebral oxygen saturation was 30–35, but was maintained at 45–70 from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to surgery completion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surgery was performed via median sternotomy on the beating heart under CPB. The surgeon docked the inflow cannula on the LV apex, made a tunnel for the driveline, and anastomosed the outflow graft and aorta. After bleeding control with deairing, the patient was weaned from CPB by carefully increasing the LVAD speed. Mean arterial blood pressure was maintained at 70–80 mmHg using dobutamine (3 mcg/kg/min), norepinephrine (0.1 mcg/kg/min) and milrinone (0.75 mcg/kg/min) during post-CPB period. Rocuronium infusion was stopped 45 min before surgery completion. Before transferring, infusion of propofol and remifentanil was stopped, and intravenous patient controlled analgesia which contains 1000 mcg of fentanyl, and 0.3 mg of ramosetron in 100 ml was started. Immediately after being transferred to the intensive care unit, the patient obeyed a simple command. One hour before extubation, oxygen saturation was maintained 94–96% with pressure support ventilation (fraction of oxygen 50%, pressure 9 cmH2O, and PEEP 5 cmH2O). Extubation was performed under the supervision of a cardiologist, physiatrist, and anesthesiologist 4 h postoperatively. Mechanical insufflation–exsufflation device with pressure of + 40 cmH2O/− 40 cmH2O was used 5 cycles for pulmonary hygiene before extubation. Immediately postextubation, oxygen saturation was maintained 99% with oxygen 2 L/min via nasal cannula, and the result of arterial blood gas analysis showed PaO2 90 mmHg, PaCO2 52 mmHg, and pH 7.31. Somnolence and carbon dioxide retention (up to 54 mmHg, pH 7.33) was observed, which recovered to 43 mmHg, pH 7.36 on the next day. The LVAD pump speed was maintained at 5000 revolutions per minute and pump flow at 2.5–3 L/min. The patient was transferred to a general ward 6 days postoperatively and received dobutamine (1–3 mcg/kg/min) without complications.\n",

      "# Reference Answer\n",
      " A term male newborn with a gestational age of 38 weeks and a weight of 3800 g presented with severe respiratory distress immediately after birth. He was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit and required endotracheal intubation for ventilatory support. On a physical examination, tachycardia, tachypnea, generalised oedema and hepatomegaly were observed. A grade IV/VI pansystolic murmur was heard at the apex with an active precordium. A chest X-ray revealed marked cardiomegaly. An ECG showed sinus rhythm with evidence of left atrial (LA) enlargement. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed severe enlargement of the LA and left ventricle (LV), moderate tricuspid regurgitation (estimated tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient of 50 mm Hg), severe MR, absence of MS and a small amount of pericardial effusion. The LV ejection fraction was 66%. The apical four-chamber view on echocardiography showed short thickened cords and enlarged elongated papillary muscles in direct continuity with the anterior and posterior MV leaflets. In addition, a column of fibrous tissue forming an arcade extending between the papillary muscles was observed in the apical four-chamber and parasternal short-axis view. The MV annulus measured 14 mm in diameter. A central coaptation gap between the anterior mitral valve leaflets (AML) and posterior mitral valve leaflets (PML) was noted due to the restrictive valvular motion, resulting in severe MR. The large MR jet flow occupied nearly the entire LA area and was directed towards the pulmonary vein. A diagnosis of MA with severe regurgitation with pulmonary hypertension was made. The patient received dobutamine, furosemide and spironolactone while receiving full ventilatory support. Additionally, fluid intake was restricted, and efforts were made to achieve a negative fluid balance. We discussed the risks and benefits of mitral valve replacement (MVR) with the cardiovascular team. Due to a lack of experience with MA repair in infants at our institute and the patient’s MV being too small for replacement, we concluded that supportive care for further growth would be the best course of action. After 1 week, the patient’s CHF was under control. A follow-up chest X-ray revealed a decrease in cardiac size. However, LA enlargement was still observed, as indicated by a double contour sign, along with mild pulmonary venous congestion. Echocardiography showed that MR had decreased to a moderate degree, with slight improvement in LA and LV enlargement. Pulmonary hypertension had improved, as demonstrated by a decrease in the tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient to 25 mm Hg. The patient was weaned off the ventilator and subsequently extubated. The medication regimen was switched to oral digoxin, furosemide and hydralazine.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day after the patient’s extubation, he developed progressive tachypnea. A physical examination showed inspiratory and expiratory rhonchi in the left lung with subcostal retraction. A CT scan of the airway was performed to evaluate airway obstruction, revealing LA enlargement measuring 2.6×3.3 cm in the maximum transaxial diameter. This atrial enlargement caused a pressure effect on the distal left main bronchus, resulting in segmental luminal narrowing, with the narrowest diameter being approximately 2 mm. The patient was supported with continuous positive airway pressure to maintain airway patency. On the 16th day of life, he developed bloody stool following fortifying high-calorically dense formula. Pneumatosis intestinalis was observed in an abdominal radiograph, confirming stage IIa necrotising enterocolitis. Nil per os, parenteral nutrition and intravenous antibiotics were required. Subsequently, on the 24th day of life, trophic feeding was initiated using breast milk and gradually increased. However, due to poor weight gain with fluid restriction and inadequate breast milk supply, a switch to high-calorically dense formula was implemented to achieve an energy intake of 130 kcal/kg/day and a protein intake of 2.7 g/kg/day via the oral route. Additionally, multivitamin, iron and zinc supplementation were provided. The airway obstruction improved after CHF was well controlled, and the patient was able to be weaned off continuous positive airway pressure. At the age of 2 months, he was discharged from hospital with a weight of 4035 g.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient was followed up by a paediatric cardiologist, paediatrician nutrition specialist and a newborn team. At 3 months of age, he experienced frequent postprandial regurgitation and non-bilious vomiting, and exhibited a suboptimal growth rate. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease was diagnosed, and management included maintaining a head elevation position during feeding and administering lansoprazole. Furthermore, energy intake was adjusted to 140–150 kcal/kg/day along with a protein intake of 2.5–3.2 g/kg/day by fortifying a high-calorically dense formula with maltodextrin, long-chain triglycerides and medium-chain triglycerides. After this treatment, his reflux symptoms were ameliorated, leading to discontinuation of lansoprazole. At 11 months of age, he showed catch-up growth with age-appropriate feeding practices and normal development. At 18 months of age, an echocardiogram showed a considerable improvement in MR, with a decrease in the LA volume index from 92.9 mL/m2 to 47.2 mL/m2. His condition is currently controlled with a low dose of furosemide and spironolactone.\n",

      "Outcome and follow-up\n",
      "\n",
      "We have followed the patient until the current time of writing this report at the age of 2 years, and his outcome is favourable regarding heart failure symptoms, airway obstruction, growth and development.

      " The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a medical history significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic hepatitis C infection, seizure disorder on levetiracetam and major depression, not on medical therapy. She was being treated with methadone (60 mg daily) maintenance therapy for opiate addiction and chronic back pain. She was witnessed by her husband to ingest a total of 2.4 g of methadone in a suicidal attempt at her home. As the paramedics arrived roughly 30 min after the witnessed overdose, the patient was unresponsive, pupils were pinpoint, Glasgow Coma Scale Score of 7, heart rate 96 beats per minute, blood pressure 101/69 mm Hg, respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 96% and blood glucose level of 157 mg/dL. She was given a total of three doses of naloxone, 1.0 mg each, with no response, and underwent endotracheal intubation for airway protection. On arrival to the emergency department, her temperature was 36.1°C, heart rate 120 beats per minute, blood pressure 79/46 mm Hg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation 97%. On physical examination, she was unresponsive. Her skin was cold and mottled, and her jugular venous pressure was elevated 15 cm H2O above the sternal angle level. Peripheral pulses were regular but weak. Auscultation yielded normal heart sounds and clear lung fields bilaterally.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Investigations\n",
      "\n",
      "Laboratory values were significant for elevated high-sensitivity troponin I value of 631 pg/mL, which peaked at 927 pg/mL, and B-type natriuretic peptide value of 428 pg/mL. Serum and urine drug screen was positive for methadone but negative for other opiates, cocaine and ethyl alcohol, and serum levetiracetam was within the therapeutic range. Arterial blood gas showed mild metabolic acidosis (pH 7.31, pCO2 31 mm Hg, and pO2 140 mm Hg), and infection workup was negative. X-ray of the chest was negative for any significant cardiopulmonary changes. CT angiography (CTA) scan of the chest showed mild dilatation of the right ventricle (RV) but no evidence of pulmonary embolism, dilatation of the pulmonary arteries or any other significant cardiopulmonary changes. Although the study was not ideal, there was no suggestion of CAD. Serial ECGs showed sinus tachycardia and prolonged corrected QT (QTc) intervals, but no significant ischaemic changes. The initial transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed dilated RV with severe systolic dysfunction and relative preservation of contractility at the apex compared with the basal segments. The tricuspid regurgitation doppler waveform was incomplete and not adequate for the estimation of the RV systolic pressure. The left ventricle (LV) size and ejection function were normal with no LV wall motion abnormalities. A TTE that was done 3 months before this presentation, for evaluation of atypical chest pain, did not show any LV or RV dilation or dysfunction or any evidence of elevated pulmonary artery pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Differential diagnosis\n",
      "\n",
      "A middle-aged woman presenting with methadone overdose, acute RV dysfunction, haemodynamic instability (ie, shock) and altered mental status. The differential diagnosis included acute myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, acute pulmonary embolism, acute intracranial pathology, sepsis and drug toxicity. CT of the head was negative for any intracranial abnormalities, CTA of the chest was negative for acute or chronic intrathoracic pathologies and no dilatation of the pulmonary artery, suggesting no chronic pulmonary hypertension. Arterial blood gas showed mild metabolic acidosis but no hypoxemia. Sepsis workup did not suggest any potential source of infection. All this workup excluded acute pulmonary process as the underlying aetiology of this presentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Concerning acute coronary syndrome (ACS) being a possible diagnosis due to haemodynamic instability, elevated cardiac enzymes and a new onset isolated and severe RV dysfunction, the patient did not have underlying cardiac risk factors, serial ECGs did not show any acute or chronic ischaemic changes, CTA of the chest was not suggestive of CAD and the RV systolic function recovered within few days. Therefore, no ischaemic cardiac workup was pursued during the hospitalisation period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the patient had a normal TTE that was done 3 months prior to the current presentation. On admission, TTE showed isolated and severe RV dysfunction. After supportive care, TTE showed a complete resolution of the RV dysfunction. This all raised the possibility of atypical stress-induced cardiomyopathy due to methadone overdose.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient was managed with intravenous isotonic fluid resuscitation (30 mL/kg), mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support (norepinephrine, the highest dose reached was 0.3 mg/kg/min). She gradually improved and was extubated on day 2. A repeat TTE on day 4 showed normalisation of the RV size and function.\n",

      "The patient was discharged home on hospital day 7 in a stable condition with instructions to follow-up as an outpatient. A follow-up TTE at 1 month post discharge revealed normal RV and LV size and function. A follow-up ECG showed normalisation of the QT interval.\n",

      " A 65-year-old female with a history of rheumatic mitral valve disease, treated with a mechanical St. Jude 25-mm bileaflet prosthetic valve 18 months ago, presented with a 2-week history of progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea. She was on warfarin for anticoagulation without aspirin because of aspirin hypersensitivity. On presentation, vital signs revealed a temperature of 98.1°F, blood pressure of 92/61 mm Hg, regular heart rhythm with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. She was alert but in acute distress. Physical examination revealed jugular venous dissension at 10 to 12 cm, basal rales bilaterally on lungs auscultation, and a trace lower limb edema. Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with nonspecific ST-T-wave changes. Chest X-ray showed bilateral diffuse interstitial prominence with bilateral pleural effusion. International normalized ratio (INR) was 3.8. Otherwise her laboratory workup was unremarkable. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed ejection fraction of 60% to 65% and not well-visualized prosthetic mitral valve with no visible mass with a mean gradient of 20 mm Hg, peak E wave velocity was 2.9 m/s. Mitral valve Doppler Velocity Index was 3.85, and a pressure half-time was 254 ms. Blood culture was negative for 3 times for any infection. Further evaluation with a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed a fixed posterior leaflet and a partially restricted anterior leaflet of the prosthetic mitral valve with no visible mass and a mean gradient of 42 mm Hg at a heart rate of 87 beats per minute. We then proceeded with computed tomography (CT) scan to better assess the mitral valve leaflet motion, which showed severely restricted movement of both prosthetic mitral valve leaflets with streak artifact near the valve ring limits evaluation for pannus. The patient was started on a heparin drip for the possible thrombotic mitral valve, and then underwent repeat TEE the next day, which showed no clear thrombus or mass on the prosthetic mitral valve, but persistent restricted prosthetic motion with elevated mean gradient at 27 mm Hg. We elected to proceed with fibrinolytic therapy for suspected prosthetic mitral valve thrombosis and started the Mayo Clinic protocol of alteplase 20 mg bolus followed by 30 mg infusion drip over 3 hours. TEE after the first round of fibrinolytic therapy showed improved mean gradient across the prosthetic mitral valve from 27 mm Hg to 18 mm Hg; however, it showed persistent fixed posterior leaflet. With the partial improvement of the mean gradient across the valve after the first course of fibrinolytic therapy, we repeated the same protocol for another course with continuous heparin drip in between the 2 courses. Repeat TTE following the second course showed further improvement in the mean gradient across the prosthetic mitral valve from 18 mm Hg to 8 mm Hg, normal movement of the anterior leaflet, and persistent fixed posterior leaflet. Afterward, she was started on warfarin plus clopidogrel, with intravenous unfractionated heparin bridging with a higher INR target of 3.5 to 4. Subsequently, she was discharged home in a stable state with the plan to reevaluate for repeat mitral valve surgery. Follow-up TEE 1-month postdischarge showed a completely normal mean pressure gradient across the mitral valve prosthetic with a properly functioning anterior and posterior valve leaflets. Subsequent 6-month follow-up TTE showed properly functioning mitral valve prosthetic with normal pressure gradient across the prosthetic.\n",

      " In spring 1992, a 17-year-old boy presented at our institution with an exacerbation of idiopathic nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and pulmonary insufficiency. He was listed at status 1 on the heart transplant waiting list (panel-reactive antibody, 13%). He needed intensive care and inotropic agents before transplantation. A heart became available from an identically sized donor who was close in age and ABO-compatible (type AB); however, results of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) tests revealed a complete mismatch, with no HLA-A, -B, or -DR antigens in common. At the time, the patient's relatively high immunologic risk for graft rejection related to his young age and degree of antigen mismatch was used to justify HHTx over orthotopic transplantation. In April 1992, HHTx was performed as previously described,10 with biatrial anastomoses to the native atria.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient's native heart function did not recover; the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was consistently below 0.15, with LV and right ventricular dilation and global hypokinesis. However, his donor heart function was excellent, with normal LV filling and an LVEF of 0.60. Atrial fibrillation and premature ventricular complexes early after HHTx were successfully managed after implantation of a pacemaker. Excellent graft function for 2 decades enabled the patient to live a moderately active life that included working full-time and playing sports with his children.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the patient was 39 years old, 22 years after the initial transplantation, he had hypertension, and coronary artery disease was found in the donor graft. In March 2013 at a different hospital, a left anterior descending coronary artery stent was placed after the patient had a non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). After a period of hyperkinesis and improved LVEF, apical akinesis in the donor heart and an overall decline in cardiac function were observed. Shows the patient's LVEF over 9 Shows a modest increase in cardiac dimensions and an inconsistent-but-rising right atrial pressure. Documents the patient's declining heart function over time; his cardiac dimensions, LVEF, and pulmonary artery systolic pressure had been stable during the 7 years before the NSTEMI.\n",

Rapid decompensation during a cardiac catheterization procedure that same month prompted arteriovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Because of an immunologic obstacle to transplantation, the patient's native heart was replaced with a total artificial heart (TAH) as a bridge to transplantation; the circulation to the heterotopic donor heart was excluded as much as possible. The patient's postoperative course was complicated by multiple episodes of bacteremia and circuit thrombosis, the latter probably caused in part by incomplete exclusion of the heterotopic graft from the circulation. However, TAH support enabled desensitization therapy with therapeutic plasma exchange.\n",

A shortness of breath, symptoms of heart failure on physical examination, and remarkable cardiomegaly with extended cardiothoracic ratio of 74% on chest x-ray were again presented when she was 78 years old. The echocardiography showed a huge echogenic mass occupying the right atrium. Sixty-four multi-detector computed tomography (CT) showed a lobulated heterogeneously enhancing mass in the right upper lobe of liver, and a continuous tumor thrombus from the portal vein and hepatic vein to the right atrium via the inferior vena cava. Alpha-fetoprotein level was >20 000 ng/mL (reference range: 0.0 to 10.0 ng/mL), and HCC was diagnosed by a contrast enhanced CT. The continuous hypercoagulability was shown more than 6 months before the last occurrence of heart failure despite of anticoagulant therapy.

      "The patient has a significant medical history including pleuropneumonia and tuberculous meningitis diagnosed 21 years ago. Eight years later, he was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma, for which he underwent chemo-immunotherapy and allogenic stem cell transplantation. Post-transplant, he experienced complications including meningitis and pneumonia due to immune suppression therapy.

      "**Emergency Department Presentation:**\n",
      "The patient presented to the Emergency Department with suspected pneumonia, characterized by dyspnoea and leg weakness lasting one week. Upon examination, he exhibited a body temperature of 39.6°C and an oxygen saturation of 96% on 3L/min oxygen supplementation, without acute respiratory distress. Physical examination revealed dullness on percussion at the lower right thorax. A chest X-ray indicated flattening of the left hemi-diaphragm, pleural effusion, and atelectasis in the right hemithorax, consistent with previously noted pleurodiaphragmatic adhesions.\n",

      "Blood samples were collected for haematological and chemical analysis, revealing significantly reduced potassium levels. The patient was supplemented with 40 mmol of potassium orally and 2.25 mmol of calcium gluconate intravenously due to low calcium levels. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed to assess for cardiac conduction disturbances but showed no abnormalities.\n",

      "Subsequent analysis revealed elevated potassium and calcium levels post-supplementation, raising concerns about potential preanalytical errors. A comparison of laboratory results indicated that the initial low electrolyte levels may have been due to contamination from an intravenous catheter flushed with sodium chloride prior to phlebotomy. Sodium and chloride levels were decreased post-supplementation, supporting this conclusion. The unnecessary electrolyte supplementation was promptly ceased, and the patient did not experience any adverse effects from the incorrect treatment.\n",

      "\n",
      "The described patient provided written informed consent. A 69-year-old male patient was referred to the Emergency department (ED) of our university hospital. The past medical history mentions pleuropneumonia and tuberculous meningitis 21 years prior to presentation. A follicular lymphoma was diagnosed 8 years later for which he was treated with chemo-immunotherapy and allogenic stem cell transplantation. Subsequent immune suppression therapy to minimize graft versus host disease after allogenic stem cell transplantation was complicated by an episode of meningitis and pneumonia. Because of this past medical history he was checked at the Haematology Department on a regular basis, during which laboratory analysis was performed to monitor renal and liver function and haematological parameters. At the most recent visit three months prior to presentation no clinically relevant abnormal laboratory results were obtained.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Emergency department presentation\n",
      "The reason for patient presentation at the ED was suspicion of pneumonia with complaints of dyspnoea, without signs of coughing. Moreover, he experienced weakness in his legs since one week. During physical examination, the patient had a body temperature of 39.6 degrees Celsius and an oxygen saturation of 96% during three litres oxygen supplementation per minute, but was not in acute respiratory distress. Percussion dullness was noticed at the lower right thorax during pulmonary examination. The chest X-ray was markedly abnormal with flattening of the left hemi-diaphragm and pleural effusion and atelectasis in the right hemithorax was observed, but this was in accordance with previous observed pleurodiaphragmatic adhesions. The abnormalities at the left were slightly increased compared to a previous observation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Laboratory analysis and patient’s treatment\n",
      "\n",
      "To support the diagnostics, the phlebotomist collected blood samples and sent these to the laboratory for haematological and chemical analysis to assess electrolytes, renal function, liver function, infection and haematological parameters. The haematological parameters were measured on an automated XN-9000 haematology analyzer (Sysmex, Norderstedt, Germany). A Cobas C-8000 automated modular analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, USA) was used to perform chemical analysis. No technical errors during laboratory analysis were reported. Strikingly reduced concentrations of potassium were observed. Therefore, the clinician decided to supplement the patient with 40 mmol potassium orally to prevent serious rhythm abnormalities. In addition, 2.25 mmol calcium gluconate was supplemented intravenously based on the low concentration of calcium analysed from the same blood sample. To investigate whether the hypokalaemia and hypocalcaemia caused cardiac conduction disturbances an electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed. However, no abnormalities consistent with low potassium or low calcium were observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results of the ECG recording combined with the elevated potassium and calcium concentrations measured from the sample post-suppletion, raised the suspicion of a preanalytical error. To investigate whether an incorrect preanalytical proceeding was the cause of the deviating laboratory outcomes, the test results before and after potassium and calcium suppletion were compared. Strikingly, after suppletion, an increase in electrolytes, proteins, leukocytes and thrombocytes were observed in specimens collected post electrolyte suppletion. Since the laboratory parameters at admission at the ED showed an overall reduction, the clinician suspected that an incorrect phlebotomy could be the underlying cause of the deviating laboratory results. Therefore, the phlebotomist who performed the specimen collection was asked for potential factors during phlebotomy that could have affected the laboratory outcomes. The median cubital vein was selected for venipuncture. Just before venipuncture, an intravenous catheter was inserted (exact time interval unknown) in close proximity distal of the puncture place. No continuous infusion was started, but the catheter was flushed with 10 mL sodium chloride. According to the phlebotomist other potential causes could be excluded. In contrast to other laboratory parameters, sodium and chloride were decreased post electrolyte suppletion, which was indicative for sodium chloride contamination. It was concluded that admixture of sodium chloride by flushing of the intravenous catheter prior to phlebotomy was the underlying cause for the deviating laboratory results and subsequently unnecessary suppletion of electrolytes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The suppletion of potassium and calcium was ceased immediately and fortunately the patient suffered no adverse effects from the wrong treatment.\n",

      "**Procedure Summary:**\n",
      "The patient underwent a diagnostic left heart catheterization in 2012, which was complicated by a left main coronary artery dissection. This complication necessitated an emergent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) involving the left anterior descending coronary artery and the obtuse marginal artery. Despite the CABG, the patient’s heart failure symptoms worsened, and her ejection fraction did not improve, leading to her transfer to our advanced heart failure clinic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the course of two years, the patient underwent multiple right heart catheterizations (RHCs), with Fick method calculations consistently indicating a normal cardiac index. However, her symptoms continued to deteriorate. Following a presentation to the medical review board, she was approved for an orthotopic heart transplant (OHT).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Transplant Procedure:**\n",
      "The transplant surgery was uneventful, but an abnormal amount of blood was noted draining from the pulmonary veins during the operation. The initial 24-hour postoperative course was characterized by a high cardiac index, right ventricular (RV) cardiac output, low systemic vascular resistance, and elevated pulmonary pressure. A suspected shunt was investigated; however, an iatrogenic shunt was ruled out via bubble echocardiography. Computed tomography (CT) scans subsequently revealed an abnormal left superior pulmonary vein draining into the innominate vein, confirming the presence of an extracardiac shunt in the form of partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR).\n",

      "**Operative Repair:**\n",
      "A multidisciplinary team decided to proceed with operative repair. The chest was reopened, and the left superior pulmonary vein (LSPV) was identified and carefully dissected from the pulmonary hilum toward the innominate vein. A tributary branch was ligated, and the vein was transected at the innominate level. An end-to-side anastomosis was performed between the LSPV and the donor heart's left atrial appendage while on cardiopulmonary bypass with a beating heart. The heart-lung machine was utilized to maintain hemodynamic stability during the procedure. Following successful anastomosis and hemostasis, the patient was weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass without the need for inotropic support. Cannulas were removed after the administration of protamine, and the chest was closed in a standard manner.\n",

      " A 62-year-old female underwent a diagnostic left heart catheterization in 2012. The procedure was complicated by a left main coronary artery dissection requiring an emergent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) of the left anterior descending coronary artery and the obtuse marginal artery. Unfortunately, the dissection of her left main coronary artery resulted in the worsening of the patient’s heart failure symptoms despite the emergent CABG. Since the patients’ ejection fraction after CABG never improved, she transferred to our advanced heart failure clinic. Over two years, multiple right heart catheterizations (RHCs) were completed; Fick method calculations consistently demonstrated a normal cardiac index. However, the patient experienced worsening symptoms. Once she was profoundly symptomatic, her case was presented at the medical review board, and she was approved for an OHT. Her transplant was uneventful; however, during surgery an abnormal amount of blood was noted draining from the pulmonary veins. Her initial 24-h post-operative course was remarkable for a high cardiac index and right ventricular (RV) cardiac output, a low systemic vascular resistance, and an elevated pulmonary pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "While a shunt was suspected, an iatrogenic shunt was ruled out via bubble echocardiography. However, computed tomography (CT) scans revealed an abnormal left superior pulmonary vein draining into the innominate vein. The CTA demonstrated the presence of an extracardiac shunt in the form of PAPVR.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a multidisciplinary decision to pursue operative repair, the chest was re-opened. The left superior pulmonary vein (LSPV) was identified and visualized. A careful dissection was initiated from the pulmonary hilum toward the innominate vein outside the pericardium. The venous connection was completely mobilized, a tributary branch was ligated, and the vein was transected at the innominate level. After mobilizing the vein, an end-to-side anastomosis was made between the LSPV and the donor heart left atrial appendage while under cardiopulmonary bypass with beating heart. The heart and lung machine was used to avoid hemodynamic instability during the exposure of the left atrial appendage for the anastomosis. After the anastomosis and hemostasis, the patient was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass and no inotropic support was required. The cannulas were removed after protamine was administered. The chest was closed in standard fashion, and the patient recovered in the intensive care unit. The patient was discharged home on Day 15.\n",

      " A 75-year-old man with permanent atrial fibrillation was referred to our hospital. Because of a high risk of cardioembolic stroke with a CHA2DS2-VASC (hypertension, age ≥75 years, coronary heart disease) score of 4 points and a strong contraindication for anticoagulants with a HAS-BLED (hypertension, labile international normalized ratios, elderly, renal dysfunction) score of 4 points, he was a good candidate for percutaneous left atrial appendage (LAA) occlusion. A standard implant procedure was performed with the patient under general anesthesia. The procedure protocol has been described previously. A WATCHMAN LAA occluder (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, Massachusetts) (diameter, 30 mm) was successfully released at the LAA ostium under fluoroscopic guidance and continuous transesophageal echocardiographic monitoring. The patient was asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable at discharge. However, he experienced acute left heart failure with dyspnea on exertion 30 days after the procedure. His symptoms were suddenly relieved with oral administration of digoxin and diuretic drugs. Echocardiographic assessment at the 45-day follow-up visit demonstrated ruptured mitral chordae tendineae, severe mitral regurgitation, and the absence of the implant either in the LAA or in any of the heart cavities. Fluoroscopic imaging confirmed that the LAA device was located in the aortic arch. After changing the direction of the device hub to the descending aorta by a deflectable ablation catheter, the device was retrieved successfully using double goose-neck snares (10 and 15 mm in diameter) via bilateral femoral artery access with 14-F sheaths.

      " A 74-year-old man underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) for a completely occluded proximal left anterior descending artery. During the procedure, microvascular flow distal to the block could not be established (no-reflow phenomenon) and thus was managed with diltiazem and nicorandil. A follow-up echocardiogram performed on the next day revealed an intraparietal echolucent apicolateral neocavitation corresponding to an intramyocardial haematoma (IMH) along with reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 30% as compared with 45% per intervention. At 1 month follow-up, he went into congestive heart failure with a further decline in EF to 25%. Although the IMH was resolving, left ventricular apex had ballooned out. At 3 months, he was rehospitalised with a storm of ventricular tachycardia and further deterioration in EF with an apical aneurysm, and finally passed away.\n",

      " A 58-year-old female with no prior medical history presented with cardiogenic shock due to viral myocarditis. She had angiographically normal coronary arteries. Bedside echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis of the left ventricle (LV) with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 10%. Right ventricular (RV) function was severely impaired. That patient needed biventricular mechanical circulatory support (MCS). Using moderate sedation, an Impella CP (Abiomed) was placed percutaneously through the left axillary artery. Subsequently, a Protek Duo device (LivaNova) was inserted into the right internal jugular (IJ) vein, positioned distally into the main pulmonary artery (PA), and connected to a TandemHeart pump (LivaNova). The patient was able to ambulate with careful supervision. Biventricular support resulted in stable hemodynamics. The biventricular support devices were weaned and removed on hospital day 6. LVEF on discharge was 50%.   To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of full biventricular MCS with the combination of Impella and Protek Duo. The Protek Duo is a dual-lumen cannula inserted via the right IJ vein, with its proximal inflow lumen positioned in the right atrium and distal lumen positioned in the main PA. These lumens are connected with the paracorporeal TandemHeart pump, which allows flow of up to 5 L/min. The alternative percutaneous option for RV support is the Impella RP (Abiomed), which must be placed in the femoral vein, preventing ambulation.\n",

      " A 67‐year‐old woman with a recurrent leiomyosarcoma had an echocardiogram (ECHO) showing a LVEF of 60% with normal cardiac function. She began doxorubicin and olaratumab but progressed 6 months later. Tumor progressed on trabectedin and pazopanib was begun; she was admitted 5 days later for shortness of breath and found to have nonischemic cardiomyopathy and HF with a traced LVEF of 12.9%. Pazopanib was stopped and she was treated medically. Five days later, she felt better, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) stress test showed a LVEF of 21% but no valve disease, infarction, fibrosis, or ischemia. Eight days after stopping pazopanib, she had no dyspnea on exertion; 4 days later she began treatment with ifosfamide with no recurrence of cardiac symptoms; five months later, LVEF was 47% by ECHO, and a month later LVEF was 51% with normal systolic function on cardiac MRI.\n",

      " A 56-year-old male presented to the emergency department of our hospital due to sudden onset shortness of breath and an episode of syncope while walking around inside his house. He underwent robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy for prostate carcinoma, 5 days prior to his presentation to the Emergency Department. His post-operative course in the hospital was uneventful. In the emergency department, his blood pressure was 94/54 mmHg, heart rate 121 beats per minute, respiratory rate 20 breathes per minute, he was afebrile, and his oxygen saturation was 92% on 6 L per minute of oxygen via nasal cannula. Cardiac examination revealed S1S2, regular, tachycardic, no murmur/gallops/rubs. Respiratory examination revealed normal vesicular breath sounds bilaterally. He was noted to have asymmetrical left lower extremity edema. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus tachycardia, no ST-T wave changes. Troponin was mildly elevated at 0.120 ng/mL (reference range: 0 to 0.020). Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of chest showed extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli, with a large clot burden in both main pulmonary arteries, evidence of acute right ventricular failure. Duplex venous scan showed acute left infra-popliteal deep vein thrombosis. Echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction of 60% to 65%, abnormal septal motion and flattening of interventricular septum, right ventricular systolic pressure of 49.7 mmHg, moderately dilated right ventricle, decreased right ventricle function, Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion of 12.1 mm (normal 15 to 20 mm). As the majority of the clot burden was distal, it was not deemed amenable to surgical extraction as recent surgery was a major contraindication for thrombolysis. The patient was started on a heparin drip and inhaled nitric oxide at 20 ppm along with oral sildenafil 40 mg every 8 hours. The next day, the patient was stable hemodynamically and his inhaled nitric oxide was tapered off. Repeat echocardiogram 48 hours from initial presentation showed improved right ventricle size and function. His right ventricular systolic pressure decreased to 22.4 mmHg and his tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion improved to 17.8 mm. We recommended that he continue sildenafil for the next month after discharge along with oral anticoagulation with a plan to follow-up as an outpatient. The patient gave written consent to treatment during his hospitalization. The patient and his family members were well-informed regarding the entire plan of care, and they were in agreement with the care plan.\n",

      "# Reference Answer\n",
      " A 35-year-old woman (gravida 1, para 1; uneventful pregnancy with history of first delivery at 32 years of age) was referred to our cardiac emergency department for the management of heart failure due to PPCM. The patient had a benign medical history before the current delivery of twin pregnancy. Her blood pressure had been within the normal range throughout the pregnancy, ranging from 111/64 to 129/75 mmHg in the absence of antihypertensive agents, and she had not developed proteinuria during the pregnancy. She was admitted to the obstetric hospital for the management of her pregnancy at 32 weeks of gestation. On admission, she was asymptomatic. However, chest radiography showed cardiac enlargement [cardiothoracic ratio (CTR), 54%], and transthoracic echocardiography showed a slightly dilated cardiac chamber and preserved LV function [LV end-diastolic dimension (LVDd)/LV end-systolic dimension (LVDs), 51/34 mm; LVEF calculated using Teichholz’s formula, 54%]. Her plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level was elevated at 138 pg/mL. At 35 weeks of gestation, she unexpectedly gained body weight, and chest radiography showed further cardiac enlargement (CTR, 58%) and left pleural effusion. Her LV dimensions and BNP level also showed slight increases (LVDd/LVDs, 54/36 mm; BNP level, 154 pg/mL), while the LVEF was still preserved (62%). Although her ratio of mitral valve inflow velocity to left ventricle wall tissue velocity was within normal range (E/e': 9.4), the trans-tricuspid pressure gradient was mildly elevated (34 mmHg), suggesting a certain degree of diastolic dysfunction had caused her pleural effusion. Her electrocardiogram did not change during pregnancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "She subsequently underwent usual vaginal delivery, and healthy twin neonates were born at 38 weeks. Immediately after delivery, progressive malaise and dyspnea developed. Chest radiography revealed pulmonary congestion and increased bilateral pleural effusion. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a severely reduced LV systolic function and increased LV dimensions. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with heart failure, and PPCM was suspected as the underlying etiology. The patient was referred to our tertiary medical center for further management.\n",
      "\n",
      "On referral to our hospital, the patient’s pulse rate was 103 beats/minute, her blood pressure was 150/97 mmHg, respiratory rate was 29 breaths/minute, and room air oxygen saturation was 94%, with a New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III. Her BNP level was elevated at 2,696 pg/mL. Chest radiography showed further cardiac enlargement (CTR, 64%) and pulmonary congestion. On transthoracic echocardiography, LVDd/LVDs was 58/53 mm, and LV wall motion exhibited severely reduced contraction, with an LVEF of 24% and only mild mitral regurgitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emergency right heart catheterization indicated progressive heart failure with a high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (25 mmHg), high pulmonary arterial pressure (40/23/30 mmHg), normal right atrial pressure (2 mmHg), and normal cardiac index (4.6 L/min/m2). We then detected an increased heart rate (from 95 to 138 beats/minute) and a gradual decrease in her cardiac index (down to 2.8 L/min/m2). Considering her low stroke volume index (20 mL/m2), we initially administered inotropes, but her heart failure continued to worsen. Thus, intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP) was used for circulatory support. Cabergorine, which is a potent dopamine receptor agonist, was prescribed at a dose of 1 mg for the suppression of lactation, due to the high metabolic demands of lactation and breastfeeding. Bromocriptine was not administered for the treatment of PPCM because the available data were insufficient to recommend its routine use. Her hemodynamic parameters improved with these multidisciplinary treatments. Her heart failure gradually improved, allowing for the removal of IABP 9 days after the insertion and the discontinuation of inotropes 15 days after infusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her hemodynamic state remained stable after weaning from inotrope therapy, and she was transferred to the ward with the following medications: 1.25 mg/day enalapril, 5 mg/day carvedilol, 20 mg/day furosemide, and 25 mg/day spironolactone. Pre-discharge laboratory tests, chest radiography, and transthoracic echocardiography showed significant improvements: CTR, 50%; LVDd/LVDs, 49/40 mm; and LVEF, 42%. Her plasma BNP level normalized to 10.2 pg/mL. During hospitalization, we excluded other. An endomyocardial biopsy performed one month after the onset of PPCM revealed no infiltrative disorders and showed that the interstitial fibrosis and interstitial edema were mild, without inflammatory cell infiltration, myocardial necrosis, or degeneration. We therefore diagnosed the patient as having PPCM. She was discharged 45 days after admission with an NYHA class I. Six months later, her BNP level decreased to 9.3 pg/mL, CTR decreased to 49%, LVDd/LVDs decreased to 44/29 mm, and LVEF improved to 53%.\n",

      " A 63-year-old female was admitted to the Emergency Department of our hospital because of a persistent pressure, like chest pain, which developed 3 hours prior to her admission. She had a history of hypertension for approximately 10 years but had no history of diabetes. She was a nonsmoker. The electrocardiogram (ECG) results showed ST-segment elevation at the precordium leads, and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was therefore suspected. The patient was transferred to the catheter lab for an emergency coronary artery angiogram (CAG). The CAG failed to show any significant stenosis in the large coronary artery. The thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow was graded at 3. The patient's chest pain relieved shortly after admission, and she was transferred to the coronary care unit (CCU) for further observation. The patient's troponin levels were monitored every 6 hours, and the pattern was consistent with that of STEMI. The peak value of troponin was 123 ng/mL. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography was performed and revealed decreased contractility of the anterior wall with a reduced ejection fraction (EF). Consistent with these findings, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed that the left atrial diameter was 31 mm, the left ventricular end-diastolic (LVED) diameter was 48 mm, and the EF was 50%. Based on the findings above, a MINOCA diagnosis was made. The patient was discharged 5 days after admission, following an uneventful observation period, with guidelines for the recommended medical therapies including dual antiplatelet therapy, stain, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and β-blockers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten days after discharge, the patient developed shortness of breath, which exacerbated with exertion. Physical examination showed that the point of maximal impulse was laterally displaced. TTE revealed that the left atrial diameter was dilated from 31 to 41 mm, the LVED was dilated from 48 to 60 mm, and the EF had dropped from 50% to 38%. An apex ventricular aneurysm with a thickness of 5.7 mm, a range of approximately 30 mm without contractility, and a hypo-echo appendage attached to the left ventricular apex area without movement with cardiac cycle were observed and the N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-ProBNP) level was 7420 pg/mL. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed a left ventricular thrombus and decreased EF. Based on these clinical findings, the patient was diagnosed as having HF, ventricular aneurysm, and mural thrombosis. The clinical symptoms of this patient were relieved by diuretic treatment and the patient was discharged with the addition of Rivaroxaban to the treatment plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "One week later, the patient came to the emergency room again with palpitations and shortness of breath. ECG revealed VT. The patient was admitted to the CCU for further treatment. Treatment with a loading dose of amiodarone, followed by a maintenance dose, failed to terminate the VT. Thereafter, amiodarone was replaced by lidocaine and esmolol. However, the VT persisted with deteriorating HF. The incessant VT lasted for 5 days before it was successfully terminated by 100 J synchronized electrical cardioversion. The VT recurred frequently and every time it was terminated through the use of electrical cardioversion. Epicardium radiofrequency ablation was performed to treat the VT, and the pericardium was punctured with the xiphoid process. Through electrophysiology mapping, the epicardium was ablated, and no VT was observed immediately after the ablation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourteen days after the ablation, the VT recurred. About 100 J synchronized cardioversion was used to terminate the VT. Informed consent was obtained from the patient and an ICD was implanted. During the 7-day follow-up period, there were no shock delivered discharges and several episodes of VT were successfully terminated by antitachycardia pacing (ATP). After consultation with a cardiac surgeon, the patient was transferred to the Surgery Department for the removal of the ventricular aneurysm, to restore the heart geometry. One month after the surgery, TTE revealed that the left atrial diameter was reduced to 31 mm, the LVED diameter was reduced to 50 mm, the EF was increased to 50%, and the mitral valve regurgitation was greatly improved. The patient was free of events during the 3-month follow-up period after the surgery.\n",

      " A 57-year-old male patient underwent HeartMate III (Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA) LVAD implantation in December 2016 due to severe ischemic cardiomyopathy. He was the first patient in Israel to receive the HarteMate III LVAD. The operative course was uneventful. Extubation was done on post-operative day 1, and the patient was discharged on day 10. One month after the implantation, controller malfunction appeared, and the numbers disappeared from the controller screen. Even after connecting the patient to an external screen, data regarding pump speed, power and flow were unobtainable. The heart team was required to deal with the dilemma of whether to re-implant a LVAD or to follow up the patient clinically. Experts from the LVAD company who came from abroad were unable to solve the problem. We decided to place the patient at the top of the waiting list for a heart transplant. In November 2017, the patient underwent heart transplantation. The post-transplant course was uneventful.\n",

      "# Reference Answer\n",
      " A 4-month-old male infant, after an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery, weighed 3000 g at birth; there were no complications during pregnancy and no family history. The infant had symptoms of mild respiratory distress for 2 months, without fever or cough. He was diagnosed with patent foramen ovale by echocardiography at the primary hospital and received no treatments. Later, the symptoms were aggravated, and his parents sought care, again at the primary hospital, 9 days later. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed features suggestive of hemangioendothelioma of liver. The hospital suggested that to the infant should be transferred to our hospital for treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examination revealed an irritable infant with cough, fever, breathlessness and cyanosis; the infant weighed 6.8 kg and was in respiratory distress with a relative ratio of approximately 130/min. The infant had multiple skin hemangiomas of varying sizes on the head, neck, right index finger, and right shank. His physical examination was remarkable for bilateral wheezy phlegm in both lung bases. The physical examination showed enlarged cardiac dullness, but there were no significant heart murmurs. Abdominal distention was noted. The liver was soft and located 8 cm below the costal margin at the right mid-clavicular line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Echocardiography showed right atrial and right ventricular dilatation with a thickened right ventricular anterior wall and interventricular septum. The normal structure of the cardiac chamber and continuous atrioventricular septum were observed. The infant was diagnosed as having severe pulmonary artery hypertension with mild tricuspid regurgitation and trivial mitral regurgitation. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed densely hypodense lesions, increased volume of liver lobes, with a clear boundary and a maximum diameter of 4.1 cm. The liver lobes had a heterogeneous internal echo and enhanced peripheral echo. Visible blood vessels were observed in the hypodense lesions. There were only a few normal liver parenchymas.\n",
      "\n",
      "A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed an enlarged, irregularly shaped liver with multiple low-density intrahepatic masses, and its CT value was approximately 43 HU. Contrast-enhanced abdomen CT showed significant enhancement in the periphery of tumor, uneven enhancement in the center part of tumor during the arterial phase, centripetal enhancement in portal vein phase and even enhancement in late phase of tumor, which was more enhanced than normal liver. The lesions were more uniformly strengthened, and their degree of strengthening was higher than that of normal liver tissue in the delayed period.\n",
      "\n",
      "The laboratory examinations showed normal values for creatine kinase, creatine kinase-MB, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, unconjugated bilirubin, serum total bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, creatinine, serum urea, and coagulant activity. However, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 19.5 uIU/mL (NL = 1.36–8.8 uIU/mL), free triiodothyronine (fT3) was 3.21 pmol/L (NL = 4.5–10.5 pmol/L), and free thyroxine was normal. Meanwhile, alpha-fetoprotein was 15434.76 Ug/L (NL = 0–25 Ug/L).\n",
      "\n",
      "After we discussed the patient's condition, the infant was diagnosed with hepatomegaly, pulmonary artery hypertension, cardiac insufficiency, pneumonia, hepatic hemangioendothelioma, hypothyroidism, and multiple hemangiomas. Then, PAH and cardiac insufficiency were managed with fluid restriction, oxygen, diuretics, and inotropic support. In addition, the pneumonia was managed with antibiotics. Because fT3 was mildly decreased, we suggested that the infant should be regularly seen for endocrinology consultation. Meanwhile, propranolol was given at a dosage of 1 mg/kg every 12 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eight days after admission, the patient underwent transcatheter arterial embolization under general anesthesia. Unfortunately, because the diagnosis was relatively clear and the condition of the infant was worsening, his parents agreed to allow the patient to undergo TAE and refused a digital subtraction angiography-guided percutaneous biopsy after we informed them of the clinical risk. In addition, the TAE was approved by the ethics committee of Ji’nan Children's Hospital. The perineum was disinfected and draped with the patient in the supine position. The femoral artery was punctured by the Seldinger technique, and 100 IU/kg of heparin was administered to avoid thrombosis. The celiac artery was catheterized with a 4-F PIG angiographic catheter (Cordis, MI) under X-ray guidance. We observed that the blood supply to the IHH was derived from the proper hepatic artery branches, including the left hepatic artery and right hepatic artery, by digital subtraction angiography. The celiac artery was catheterized again with a 4-F Cobra guide catheter (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) under X-ray guidance. Then, the 2.6 F microcatheter (Asahi, Nagoya, Japan) was used for superselective catheterization of the feeding artery. During the procedure, a pingyangmycin-lipiodol emulsion was injected slowly through the catheter until the periphery of the hemangioma was completely surrounded. Gelatin sponge particle (350–560 μm) embolization of the feeding artery was performed if the blood supply artery was faster, as shown by angiography. Selective celiac arteriography was performed once again if necessary to judge the degree of embolism of the supplying arteries. The injection was stopped when a small branch of the portal vein around the tumor was developed or the total volume was administered. At the conclusion of the embolization, the microcatheter was withdrawn, and the sheath was removed. Hemostasis of the femoral artery was then achieved by manual compression for 10 to 15 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Postoperatively, meticulous nursing care was given to the patient, and symptomatic relief and supportive treatment were continued. Thirty-five days after admission, the PAH decreased, the symptoms of cardiac insufficiency were alleviated, and the severe pneumonia was cured. On the third month after the TAE, the abdominal distention was alleviated. The liver was soft and located 2 cm below the costal margin at the right mid-clavicular line. A CT scan of the abdomen still showed an irregularly shaped liver with multiple significantly strengthened intrahepatic masses, and the size of the largest mass was 1.6 cm. Echocardiography showed normal pulmonary artery pressure and EF. The patient underwent a second TAE under general anesthesia. There were no serious complications after the operation. At the 1-year follow-up, the infant had steadily gained weight, the liver volume and size of the mass decreased considerably, and the hypothyroidism returned to normal.\n",

The response exhibits an understanding of the topic and follows a logical flow, making it accurate and without made-up content.

While the response has outlined the medical history, surgical procedure, and postoperative management, there are a few areas where more information could have been provided. For example, the clinical findings section could have benefited from more precise measurements of the patient's respiratory function, rather than only mentioning a \"severe restrictive pattern.\" Moreover, the preoperative management section failed to elaborate on the pulmonary rehabilitation techniques and their potential impact on the patient's respiratory function. Lastly, the discharge plan and instructions for home care sections could have been expanded with more explicit guidance for the patient and his caregivers. However, the majority of the aspects mentioned in the score rubric have been adequately covered in the response, including the admission and discharge details, surgical procedure, and postoperative course.

The patient's diagnoses, treatments, and follow-up are accurately detailed, which aligns with the task description. The summary is clear, well-structured, and devoid of fabricated content. It adheres closely to the patient's actual history and clinical progression. The explanation of the complications, such as airway obstruction and necrotising enterocolitis, along with their management and eventual resolution, reflects a thorough understanding of the case. Additionally, the subsequent diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and its management show a comprehensive approach to the patient's care. The conclusion that the patient's outcome is favorable and the mention of regular follow-ups with a paediatric cardiologist and nutrition specialist underscores a commitment to the patient's long-term well-being.
