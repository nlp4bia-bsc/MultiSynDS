       "'A 64-year-old female lifelong smoker with no previous cardiac history presented with a 4-day history of dyspnoea on minimal exertion (New York Heart Association class III). Electrocardiography showed broad complex monophasic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and troponin T was elevated. She was treated initially with intravenous amiodarone and adenosine with no sustained effect.\\n\\nTransthoracic echocardiography showed a severely dilated left ventricle (LV) with a large aneurysm and severely impaired ventricular function. The ejection fraction was less than 10%. Coronary angiography showed a long segment of moderate to severe disease in the left coronary system and a small right coronary artery with no flow limiting disease. Recurrent intermittent episodes of VT became persistent and intractable. Direct current cardioversion was attempted on at least 20 separate occasions, resulting in only transient amelioration of arrhythmia. Percutaneous coronary intervention was undertaken successfully to the left anterior descending artery to reduce ischaemic burden. Multiple defibrillations were required during the procedure. Intra-aortic counterpulsation balloon pump and transvenous pacing were inserted owing to increasing haemodynamic instability of the patient and VT unresponsive to medical treatment.\\n\\nThe patient underwent emergency remodelling of the LV combined with subendocardial resection of the arrhythmogenic scar tissue. LV remodelling was accomplished by insertion of an elliptical patch of porcine pericardium at the junction of the normal myocardium and scar tissue. The operation was guided by three-dimensional transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE).\\n\\nThe immediate postoperative TOE showed an ejection fraction of 67.2% (10% preoperatively) and estimated LV stroke volume of 58.2ml. The patient made an uneventful recovery from surgery with complete resolution of VT. She was discharged home ten days later.\\n\\n'"

      "Clinical history\n",
      "\n",
      "Four years before the admission described in this paper, a 13-year-old male patient, known to have idiopathic biventricular dilated cardiomyopathy, was registered in our Emergency Institute for Cardiovascular Diseases and Transplantation. He was included on the waiting list for heart transplantation. After two years, his condition worsened and presented the clinical picture of cardiogenic shock. At that time, he was urgently hospitalized, intubated and ventilated, with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) back-up. As the creatinine level was slightly elevated, he also needed renal support. A cf-LVAD was implanted at another clinic.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the early postoperative phase, the pump’s power consumption increased. This was an indicator of possible pump thrombosis. Unfractionated heparin and systemic thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was carried out. As the pump function did not improve, it was replaced with another pump six days after LVAD implantation. After another two weeks, a transient stroke and mild pancreatitis were diagnosed, without significant complications. In the early and late postoperative days, several bleeding episodes occurred, one with cardiac tamponade, which required reintervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "During hospitalization, the patient presented with a fever (38°C) and elevated serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP >200 mg/dL; normal range <5 mg/dL). As a sputum culture was positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae and coliform bacilli, Meropenem and Vancomycin were administrated with good results.\n",
      "\n",
      "After obtaining normal LVAD function, progressively increasing systemic blood pressure required the long-term administration of Enalapril 20 mg bis in die (BID – twice a day) and Bisoprolol 5 mg quaque die (QD – once a day). As renal function improved after the LVAD implant, there was no need for diuretics at discharge.\n",
      "\n",
      "No other significant or uncontrolled events occurred in the first year. At 12 months after the LVAD implant, the patient suffered two episodes of brain hemorrhage, for which he was hospitalized and operated on twice in the Clinic of Neurosurgery, without sequelae. In the following six months, he had another three small hemorrhagic strokes causing hemianopsia, without motor deficit. He also showed repeated episodes of kidney decompensation, with serum creatinine levels up to 2.7 mg% (normal ranges 0.6–1.2 mg%). This was kept under control with diuretics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient neglected to have properly monitored coagulation parameters in the ambulatory and did not regularly control the blood pressure values.\n",
      "\n",
      "Present admission\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinical findings\n",
      "\n",
      "At 18 months after LVAD implant, the 17-year-old normosthenic male was hospitalized with the suspicion of acute appendicitis. We noted altered general status, intense abdominal pain, headache, dyspnea, and fatigue after limited physical effort. On admission, the patient was conscious, partially cooperative and without fever. Cardio-respiratory function was checked: pump sound was detected with cardiac auscultation, there was no palpable peripheral pulse, mild peripheral edema, no pulmonary crackles. The medium systolic blood pressure was 100 mmHg. On palpation of the abdomen, there was no muscular defense, but the liver was enlarged.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient was undergoing therapy with anti-hypertensive medication, which included an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (Enalapril 20 mg BID) and alpha–beta blocker (Carvedilol 12.5 mg BID). Long-term treatment with an antiaggregant (Aspirin 100 mg QD), an anticoagulant [Acenocoumarol QD for international normalized ratio (INR) 2–3], a diuretic (Furosemide 40 mg QD) and a proton pump inhibitor (Omeprazole 20 mg BID), was also declared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laboratory examinations\n",
      "\n",
      "On admission, the hematological and serum biochemical analyses showed a compensated renal function (creatinine – 1.13 mg/dL, creatinine clearance – 98 mL/min, urea – 36.8 mg%), with mild elevated uric acid (9.81 mg%, with normal ranges of 3.5–7.2 mg/dL). Liver enzymes were within normal ranges, with serum glutamic–oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) of 9 IU/L (normal ranges 5–34 IU/L) and glutamate–pyruvate transaminase (GPT) of 6 IU/L (normal value <55 IU/L), same as the value of total bilirubin (0.47 mg/dL).\n",
      "\n",
      "A slightly high level of serum procalcitonin (1 ng/mL, with normal range <0.5 ng/mL), and a normal value of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), respectively 110 mg/dL, were also reported. An acute infection was dismissed by normal serum level of CRP (5 mg/dL) and total leukocytes, which were 6000/μL (normal values 3600–10 000/μL) [6].\n",
      "\n",
      "Coagulation parameters showed a poorly controlled risk of hemorrhage, with an INR value of 5.4, under anti-coagulant treatment (reference for INR: 2–3). This was associated with normal platelets (275 000/μL; normal range 150 000–450 000/μL) and low hemoglobin values (8.6 g/dL; normal ranges 11–17 g/dL).\n",
      "\n",
      "During hospitalization, the laboratory examinations indicated the progressive development of multiple organ failure syndrome (MOFS). Two weeks after admission, renal failure was proved by the following parameters: high creatinine (9.02 mg%); low creatinine clearance (10 mL/min; normal reference ranges 107–139 mL/min); uremia (235 mg%); hypoproteinemia (plasma proteins: 5 g/dL; normal values 6.4–8.3 g/dL); low plasma albumin (2.2 g/dL; normal values 3.5–5.2 g/dL); high uric acid (17.66 mg%). Liver enzymes were kept within normal ranges (GOT – 23 IU/L, GPT – 17 IU/L), with progressively increasing total bilirubin (2.02 mg/dL) and LDH (222 mg/dL) and normal values of leukocytes (9120/μL). Hemoglobin decreased to 6.8 g/L.\n",
      "\n",
      "The urine test detected hematuria, proteinuria and leukocyturia, without detection of nitrites, bilirubin, or urobilinogen and without modification of the urine density (1.025; normal values 1.005–1.030).\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagistic investigations\n",
      "\n",
      "On admission, chest X-rays showed no modifications of the lungs, a dilated heart and the LVAD in the apex of the LV. An electrocardiogram revealed left fascicular hemiblock and right bundle branch block, with a heart rate of 80 beats/min (bpm). The echocardiography showed dilatation of all ventricular and atrial cavities, with decreased ejection fraction (EF) of the LV at 10% (normal value >60%). Moderate hypokinetic right ventricle, mitral and tricuspid regurgitation was diagnosed, with properly working inflow cannula at the apex of the LV.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abdominal ultrasound examination detected hepatosplenomegaly and enlarged kidneys, with increased echogenicity of the renal cortex. A pseudonodular lesion was described at the lower splenic pole, without enlargement of the appendix. In the first days, the computed tomography (CT) examination of the cranial cavity did not show acute parenchymatous lesions but confirmed the patient’s history of repeated strokes. Through the 38/33 mm (centro-central/latero-lateral) right parietal craniotomy orifice, minimal extracranial herniation of the brain tissue was obvious. Hypodense lesion located at the level of the left lentiform nucleus and at the body of the left caudate nucleus, was suggestive of a healed ischemic stroke, with associated porencephalia.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the three months of hospitalization, CT scans performed during the seizures revealed new hemorrhagic outbreaks. In the last stages, chest X-ray showed diffuse veiling of both lung areas, which were treated as a bronchopneumonia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diagnosis, therapy, and evolution\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on clinical and paraclinical examinations, the case was interpreted on admission as decompensated right heart failure with poor control of anticoagulation parameters in a patient with an LVAD implant.\n",
      "\n",
      "To prevent stroke and pump thrombosis in patients with LVAD implants, the systolic blood pressure should be maintained at a mean value of 70–80 mmHg. To achieve this, it was necessary to add the calcium blocker Amlodipine (10 mg QD) to the ACE inhibitor and alpha–beta blocker. The INR values were controlled with anticoagulants. Persistent headache with episodes of seizures and increased intracranial pressure were treated with osmotic diuretics (Mannitol) and neuroprotectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although an initial improvement was obtained, it was followed by the gradual deterioration of the general condition of the patient, with increased intensity of the headache. Hepato-renal failure occurred at two weeks after admission, followed by episodes of hemoptysis and worsening of peripheral edema. Blood pressure progressively collapsed, with gradual reduction of diuresis, up to 500 mL/day, and positive inotropic treatment with Dobutamine was needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The LVAD controller indicated low flow alarms. The repeated echocardiography revealed significant dilatation of the ventricular and atrial cavities, with worsening of the right heart failure. Antibiotics, hepatoprotectives, gastroprotectives and analgesics, at progressively increasing doses, completed diuretic treatment on continuous infusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the final stage, MOFS occurred. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) was initiated but, after 48 hours, the fatal cerebral hemorrhage was diagnosed. Death occurred three months after the final admission, 21 months after the LVAD implant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Autopsy findings\n",
      "\n",
      "The trephination orifices in the skull, which were performed over six months before the final admission, were identified in the occipital and temporal areas, with mild brain herniation. In the edematous brain parenchyma, reactive gliosis was confirmed under the microscope, as corresponding to these orifices. In the fronto-parietal area, multiple foci of parenchymatous hemorrhages were observed, the largest hematoma being 65×45 mm, which exerted mass effect over the median line. Multiple diapedesis hemorrhages were also seen (Figure ​(Figure1,1, D and E).\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the heart, the LVAD from the apex of the LV did not associate signs of thrombosis or dehiscence. Iatrogenic pericardial adherences were identified. The heart weight was 882 g, with dilatation of the cavities, causing secondary mitral and tricuspid insufficiency. No coronarosclerosis or thrombosis of the coronary arteries was observed. Histological findings consisted of marked fibrosis of the myocardium, along with a focus of septic abscess located at the level of the anterior wall of the LV.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examination of the lungs and respiratory tract revealed bilateral dystelectasia, which was clearly visible on the background of a brown parenchyma. Under the microscope, disseminated hemorrhages, with siderophages inside the alveolar spaces, which were colored in blue with Perls Prussian Blue staining, were admixed with neutrophils. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was proved by the presence of focal hyaline membranes upon alveolar septa, as indicators of shock lung.\n",
      "\n",
      "Centrilobular liver necrosis suggested the diagnosis of shock liver. The 380 g spleen showed, on the cut section, a 40×20×10 mm triangular, yellowish area, which was confirmed under the microscope as a superinfected splenic infarction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The enlarged kidneys (left – 380 g; right – 355 g) showed, on cut section, changes compatible with a diagnosis of shock kidney, i.e., medullary hyperemia and a pale, ischemic renal cortex. Microscopic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of shock kidney. Routine Hematoxylin–Eosin (HE) staining also revealed extensive glomerular changes, which consisted of an enlarged mesangial area, with focal glomerular sclerosis, highlighted in green with Masson’s trichrome staining. Crescentic proliferation of parietal cells of Bowman’s capsule was observed, without neutrophils. Interstitial nephritis was also documented.\n",
      "\n",
      "In paraffin-embedded kidney parenchyma tissue, IHC stainings were also performed. We used the cell–cell adhesion marker cluster of differentiation (CD) 44 (Dako©, Denmark, 1:50 dilution, sodium citrate pH 6 retrieval), Wilms’ tumor 1 (WT1) protein antibody (Dako©, Denmark, ready-to-use, high pH retrieval) and the stem cells-related markers CD133 (Millipore©, Denmark, 1:50 dilution, high pH retrieval) and octamer-binding transcription factor-3/4 (Oct-3/4) (Leica©, UK, 1:50 dilution, high pH retrieval). In the affected glomeruli, CD44 proved to mark the proliferated parietal cells, while WT1 positivity was clearly seen in the remnant podocytes and the mesangial cells. No positivity for CD133 or Oct-3/4 was highlighted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the above-mentioned autopsy findings, renal failure was explained by a mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis with extracapillary crescents and segmental glomerulosclerosis. Repeated hemorrhagic episodes, associated with terminal hemorrhagic pneumonia, also contributed to progressive degradation of the general status.\n",

      "\n",
      "The patient was being followed up at InCor since the age of 48 years, diagnosed with Chagas disease. She initially complained of palpitations, which subsided after amiodarone was prescribed. In addition, she had systemic arterial hypertension.\n",

      "The patient remained asymptomatic until 2013 (57 years of age) using hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg), spironolactone (25 mg), carvedilol (12.5 mg), enalapril (20 mg) and amiodarone (100 mg) daily. In April 2013, she had a resuscitated cardiac arrest, preceded by malaise and sustained ventricular tachycardia, receiving an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) with cardiac pacemaker programing for bradycardia episodes (ICD-T - ICD with antibradycardia and antitachycardia pacing and shock), being prescribed 600 mg of amiodarone daily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five days before that episode, she had upper digestive bleeding with hematemesis, when endoscopy revealed gastric ulcer with no active bleeding, and clean base (Forrest III), with a lower risk for rebleeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient experienced appropriate shock in May 2014. She was receiving an amiodarone dose lower than prescribed, thus the dose was increased, but the patient did not tolerate it because of dyspepsia. A cardiac electrophysiology study was indicated, aimed at the possible ablation of the sustained ventricular tachycardia pathways.\n",

      "The chest X-ray revealed pulmonary congestion and more severe cardiomegaly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The echocardiogram (August 4, 2014) revealed: aorta, 27 mm; left atrium, 43 mm; ventricular septal thickness, 9 mm, posterior wall, 8 mm; left ventricular diameters, 68/57 mm; LVEF, 30%. The left ventricle showed eccentric hypertrophy and reduced systolic function due to an inferolateral wall aneurysm (mid and basal segments) and an apical aneurysm. The right ventricle was normal. There was moderate mitral valve regurgitation. The pulmonary artery pressure was 25 mm Hg.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her coronary tomography angiography (July 28, 2014) evidenced no coronary lesion. The cardiac electrophysiology study (July 31, 2014) identified poorly-tolerated sustained ventricular tachycardia triggered by extra-stimuli, which required electric cardioversion. The electroanatomic mapping revealed a scar associated with low and slow late potentials in the lateral (mid and basal segments), antero-lateral (mid and basal segments) and inferolateral (mid and basal segments) walls. Because of the proximity to the circumflex sub-branches, the radiofrequency pulses were not delivered through the epicardium, but through the endocardium. After the procedure, the new stimuli no longer triggered ventricular tachycardia similar to that initially observed. However, several poorly tolerated tachycardias of different morphologies were triggered, requiring cardioversion.\n",
      "\n",
      "On outpatient follow-up (November 2014), the patient complained of dyspnea on exertion and dizziness when changing from supine to orthostatic position.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her physical examination (November 11, 2014) revealed: weight, 70 kg; height, 1.7 m; arterial blood pressure, 102/80 mmHg; heart rate, 68 bpm. The pulmonary auscultation was normal. On cardiac auscultation, her heart rhythm was regular with no abnormal heart sound, and a systolic heart murmur was heard over the mitral area (++/4+). The abdominal examination was normal. There was no edema, and her pulses were palpable and symmetrical. Because of her complaints and arterial blood pressure levels, hydrochlorothiazide was suspended, and the other medications, maintained.\n",

Her physical examination revealed an emaciated patient (53 kg), on regular general condition, tachypneic, with heart rate of 72 bpm, arterial blood pressure of 95/60 mm Hg, and O2 saturation of 92%. Her auscultation revealed rales over the pulmonary bases, rhythmic heart sounds, and systolic heart murmur over the mitral area (++++/6+).

There was an irregular nodule measuring 2.3 x 2.5 x 1.9 cm in the transition between the medial and lateral segments of the middle lobe, in addition to diffuse ground-glass opacity with septal thickening, mainly in the bases, compatible with congestion. Furthermore, there was a peripheral hyperdense area, close to the pleural surface of the right superior lobe, suggestive of subacute parenchymal bleeding or accumulation of amiodarone. The pulmonary vascularization was increased, and there was small bilateral pleural effusion. In the liver, low-density nodules were identified, but their assessment was limited due to lack of contrast media imaging. In addition, there were sparse nodular calcifications in the liver parenchyma, whose density was diffusely increased (suggestive of amiodarone deposition). Dilation of the inferior vena cava and of the hepatic veins, as well as ectasia of the gallbladder, was observed. No lymph node enlargement was identified. The heart was diffusely enlarged, with predominance of the left atrium.\n",

      "Patient B., 52 years old, was urgently admitted to the Specialized Cardiosurgical Clinical Hospital named after Academician B.A. Korolev (Nizhny Novgorod, Russia) where he was diagnosed with acute dissection of the thoracic aorta, aortic valve insufficiency, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, cardiovascular failure IIA, and NYHA functional class III. The patient suddenly became ill 2 days before the admission; he felt a sharp piercing pain behind the sternum radiating into the inter-scapular area and further along the spine. The next day, a paroxysm of atrial fibrillation developed and was stopped with a medication (amiodarone 300 mg). The patient was admitted to the Uren District Hospital (Nizhny Novgorod Region, Russia), where echocardiography revealed an enlargement of the ascending aorta up to 7 cm with the presence of fluid in the pericardial cavity (about 200 ml). The patient was then transferred to the Specialized Cardiosurgical Clinical Hospital named after Academician B.A. Korolev for surgical treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "On admission: a serious condition, clear consciousness, an active position, skin and visible mucous membranes of a physiological color, normosthenic constitution. In the lungs: breathing with a bronchial component, no wheezing, respiratory rate — 18 per minute. Rhythmic heart sounds with a heart rate of 76 per minute. Auscultation — no heart sound abnormality. BP — 110/50 mm Hg under medication support. The abdomen is soft and painless. The liver is not enlarged. No peripheral edema. Physiological functions are normal.\n",
      "\n",
      "ECG data on admission: sinus regular rhythm with a heart rate of 82 per minute, without signs of myocardial ischemia. Repeated echocardiography revealed an enlarged segment of the ascending aorta up to 70 mm, hemopericardium up to 200 mm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emergency surgery for vital signs was performed: a Bentall–de Bono procedure (conduit consisting of a MEDINZH-2 mechanical aortic valve with a diameter of 27 mm (MedInzh, Russia) and a Vascutek Gelweave vascular prosthesis (Vascutek Ltd., UK) with a diameter of 30 mm) and distal anastomosis area plastic using the sandwich technique. Normothermic perfusion was maintained for a total of 203 min. Crystalloid cardioplegia with Custodiol solution (4000 ml total) was used for myocardial protection. The aorta was clamped for a total of 164 min.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the restoration of cardiac activity, signs of bleeding appeared; the source was found in the anastomosis to the right coronary artery (RCA). When trying to suture the anastomosis on the beating heart, the rate of bleeding increased. It was decided to extend this anastomosis by using an auto-venous graft. A fragment of the great saphenous vein 5 cm long was taken from the left tibia. The aorta was clamped again. The cardioplegic solution was administered into the root. The previous anastomosis to RCA and the conduit were removed. The RCA orifice was reduced to 5 mm and a distal anastomosis was formed of the auto-vein “end to end” along the axis. Then, a fragment of the auto-vein was replaced to the conduit and a proximal “end to side” anastomosis was applied along the axis directed to 6 o’clock. After the cardiac activity recovered, a pacemaker rhythm was imposed with a heart rate of 80 per minute. Hemodynamics got stabilized. Osteosynthesis of the sternum was performed using wire sutures. Surgical wounds on the chest and right groin were sutured layer-by-layer.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the patient was transferred to the ICU, he experienced progression of acute heart failure, extreme instability of hemodynamics, and hyperenzymemia, which necessitated an increase in cardiotonic support. Since the patient’s heart rhythm was driven with a pacemaker, no ECG record for signs of ischemia was possible. A decision was made to perform an emergency selective coronary angiography: the test showed no filling of the RCA orifice; all subsequent attempts to conduct a coronary guidewire were unsuccessful. Diagnoses of acute coronary syndrome, acute lower Q-wave myocardial infarction, and condition after a Bentall–de Bono procedure were then made.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient underwent emergency myocardial revascularization by repeating RCA bypass grafting. Peripheral arteriovenous ECMO was initiated. Normothermic perfusion was run for a total of 60 min, while the aorta was clamped for 36 min. Revision of coronary arteries revealed no pulsation of RCA in plastic zone and the following additional auto-venous graft; both vessels looked collapsed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The decision was made to bypass the posterior descending artery accessible to bypassing in its proximal third. A distal “end to side” anastomosis was performed between the posterior descending artery and the auto-vein along the axis, by using a 7-0 prolene without additional sutures. The shunt was connected to the vascular prosthesis. A proximal anastomosis of a venous shunt was formed with an orientation of 5 o’clock. As a result, the shunt showed pulsation and was well drained off. Cardiac activity in the form of ventricular fibrillation and asystole was recorded, a pacemaker was imposed. An attempt was made to slow down the heart-lung machine, which resulted in a decrease in the central hemodynamics indices. It was then decided to connect another ECMO apparatus via peripheral circulation. Thus, the femoral vein was exposed 2 cm below the inguinal fold on the right and cannulated with a 27 Fr cannula according to Seldinger. The ECMO procedure was launched by using a Stockert S3 perfusion system (Sorin Group, Germany) and a Medos HILITE 7000 oxygenator (Medos, Germany). With the help of this additional ECMO, the hemodynamics got stabilized. Decannulation of the right heart was performed, and the wound closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient was transferred to the ICU in critical condition. Arteriovenous ECMO was performed at the following parameters: perfusion flow — 5.21 L/min; perfusion index — 2.4 L/min/m2). Using epinephrine and norepinephrine (VIS — 35 units) for inotropic support, we observed stable hemodynamic parameters: BP of 90–95/70–75 mm Hg. Ultrasound examination showed a sharp decrease in the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to 30%, the right ventricle — to 22% with diffuse hypokinesis. The myocardial damage markers were creatine phosphokinase-MB (CPK-MB) at 500 ng/ml, troponin I at 200 ng/ml. Hyperenzymemia was also noted: the level of AST increased up to 2331 units, ALT — to 972 units, CPK — to 6145 units, lactate dehydrogenase — to 2633 units. It was then decided to add gaseous nitric oxide to the ECMO circuit. To generate nitric oxide, we used a device (Tianox; RFNC-VNIIEF, Russia) that produced nitric oxide from the ambient air, supplied it into the extracorporeal circuit, and monitoring/regulating NO concentration in the supplying mixture. The average dosage of nitric oxide was 40 ppm; the average NO2 concentration was 0.2–1.1 (0.80±0.06) ppm. The level of methemoglobin (MetHb) at all stages of the procedure did not exceed 1.5%. A session of efferent therapy — prolonged hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) was started after 3 h.\n",
      "\n",
      "After 8 h, a decrease in myocardial damage markers was noted: CPK-MB — down to 144 ng/ml, troponin I — down to 126 ng/ml. During that time, ECMO was performed with the calculating flow, and stable hemodynamics was maintained by increased doses of epinephrine and norepinephrine (VIS was 55 units). Diffuse hypokinesis of both left and right ventricles was noted and the LVEF decreased to 19%.\n",
      "\n",
      "A significant improvement in the patient’s condition was observed only after 24 h exposure to NO-containing ECMO and ongoing hemodiafiltration. There was a decrease in both the dose of the inotropic drugs administered (VIS — to 7 units) and the concentration of the myocardial damage markers (CPK-MB — to 30.4 ng/ml, troponin I — to 50 ng/ml). The first hemodiafiltration session was completed after 24 h.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifty-eight hours after starting the procedure, a gradual decrease in ECMO performance was initiated by reducing the perfusion flow (75–50–25% of the total volume rate); during that period, nitric oxide was continuously supplied to the oxygenator. At this stage, an increase in LVEF up to 45% and restoration of contractility of both the left and right ventricles was noted. Myocardial damage markers also decreased: CPK-MB — to 9.2 and 6.9 ng/ml after 48 and 72 h, respectively; troponin I dropped to 38.9 and 5.6 ng/ml after 48 and 72 h, respectively. After 48 h, the VIS was reduced to 6 units, and after 72 h — to 3 units. Twelve hours after the first session, a second portion of renal replacement therapy (RRT) was performed to treat multiple organ failure. During the RRT session, the manifestations of acute heart failure and multiple organ failure almost completely ceased. ECMO was discontinued 82 h later and the patient was decannulated. He showed stable hemodynamic parameters and myocardial contractile function. On day 5 after the operation, the patient was extubated; he maintained clear consciousness, adequate spontaneous breathing, satisfactory acid-base balance, and close to normal parameters of the blood chemistry. In total, he stayed in the ICU for 11 days. The postoperative wound of the sternum healed by primary intention.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient was discharged from the clinic on day 18 after the operation. At the time of discharge, he had: ECG — with the sinus rhythm and a heart rate of 84 per minute; QRST — with no change; echocardiography — end-diastolic/systolic volume (EDV/ESV) — 161/83 ml; LVEF — 51%; the aortic valve prosthesis function was not impaired; aortic pressure gradient — 9/6 mm Hg; 0–I degree regurgitation; the mean pulmonary artery pressure was 32 mm Hg; 6-minute walk test — 280 m; Rehabilitation Routing Scale score was 4.\n",

      "A 21-year-old man initially presented with shortness of breath and abdominal swelling. He was found to be in renal failure with urinary retention and subsequent imaging confirmed severe bilateral hydronephrosis requiring bilateral nephrostomies. He described a 4-month history of progressive shortness of breath on exertion, orthopnoea, weight loss and general malaise. Three months prior to this he had been treated by his general practitioner with a course of oral antibiotics for a productive cough, fevers and shortness of breath. There was no significant past medical history and family history was not suspicious for cardiomyopathy or sudden cardiac death. He was an ex-smoker, having stopped 3 years earlier. Alcohol and illicit drug use were denied, however there was a history of regular ‘Energy drink’ drink consumption, specifically consuming an average of four 500 mL cans per day for approximately 2 years. Each can contains 160 mg of caffeine in addition to taurine and various other ingredients. Retrospectively, the patient recalls occasional symptoms of dyspepsia, tremor and a racing heartbeat but without seeking medical review. In the 3 months prior to admission he was unable to continue his university studies due to his lethargy and feelings of ill health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Creatinine on presentation was 562 μmol/L, with urea of 47.4 mmol/L. Bilateral nephrostomies were inserted on day 3 of admission, with little subsequent improvement in renal function. He did not require any cardiovascular or respiratory support. On examination he was found to be in decompensated cardiac failure with pitting oedema to his knees and ascites. Clinically, he was not in pulmonary oedema. ECG demonstrated minor non-specific findings. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a dilated left ventricle (LV) with a severely reduced ejection fraction (EF), biplane EF 11% with no left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), a dilated right ventricle (RV) with impaired systolic function, bi-atrial dilatation, mild mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation and a small localised pericardial effusion 0.4 cm in size. There were bilateral ventricular thrombi caused by stasis requiring systemic anticoagulation with intravenous unfractionated heparin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient was then transferred to a tertiary hospital with access to advanced mechanical circulatory support in the event of deterioration. His admission was complicated by subclinical embolic and hypoperfusion-related cerebral infarcts, uraemic encephalopathy requiring emergency haemodialysis and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Haemodialysis was initiated on the intensive care unit on day 9, requiring a small amount of norepinephrine vasopressor support initially (0.04 μg/kg/min) but no inotropic agents were required. At the time there was concern that initiation of dialysis might result in cardiovascular collapse, which fortunately did not occur. This suggests that the low cardiac output was likely to have been chronic over a period of months for such haemodynamic compensation to occur. Given his intracardiac thrombi and renal failure, he initially received anticoagulation with intravenous unfractionated heparin. On day 9 of unfractionated heparin treatment his platelet count was noted to be 70×109/L following a gradual decline over the previous week (lowest platelet count 26×109/L on day 12). A positive heparin-induced thrombocytopenia screen resulted in a switch to argatroban. The patient stabilised on the intensive care unit but remained in cardiac and renal failure requiring regular haemodialysis without improvement in cardiac function and remaining haemodynamically stable off vasopressor support and without any inotrope requirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was referred and subsequently transferred for consideration of combined cardiac and renal transplantation. While urological investigations were being carried out to assess the suitability for kidney transplantation, his urine output via nephrostomies and urinary bladder improved with stable renal chemistry and fluid status, allowing a break from dialysis. Invasive assessment of his cardiac output with right heart catheterisation indicated that this was adequate, so imminent cardiac transplantation or mechanical circulatory support was not required at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifty-eight days after his initial presentation he was discharged home from hospital with ongoing cardiology, renal and urology follow-up with a creatinine of 383 μmol/L. His repeat outpatient cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) scan after 2 months showed improvement in LVEF to 18% and repeat transthoracic echocardiogram at 9 months post discharge showed further improvement of LVEF to 51% with normal right ventricular function. His CMR indicated that there was no scar, inflammation or oedema.\n",

Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion 14 mm. RV S’ 0.09 m/s, dilated right atrium (24 cm2), small pericardial effusion 0.4 cm atrial side, mild tricuspid regurgitation, RV systolic pressure 32 mmHg+right atrial pressure, mild mitral regurgitation, other valves were normal.\n",
      "CMR imaging (1) (11/12/19): CMR imaging showed a non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy with global severely impaired LV and RV systolic function, with LVEF of 9% and RVEF of 16%, severe bi-atrial dilatation with multiple LV and RV thrombi noted. No myocardial fibrosis, infiltration or infarction.\n",
      "CMR imaging (2) (14/2/20): CMR imaging showed improving but still severely impaired global LV systolic function (LVEF 18%). The mid inferior lateral wall is relatively more hypokinetic and there is improvement in RV function (RVEF 33%). No myocardial oedema and no obvious thrombi although gadolinium was not used on this occasion.\n",
      "Transthoracic echocardiogram (2) (10/6/20) showed a normal LV cavity size (LV diameter 5.7 cm) with global moderate impairment of systolic function (LVEF 38%). Normal RV size and function, normal bi-atrial sizes.\n",
      "Transthoracic echocardiogram (3) (18/8/20) showed a normal LV cavity size with mildly impaired systolic function (LVEF 51%). Normal RV size and function, normal bi-atrial sizes.\n",
      "Right heart catheterisation.\n",
      "MRI brain/spinal cord/lumbar spine (17/12/19): Combination of cardioembolic and hypoperfusion acute infarcts. The extensive bilateral subcortical acute infarcts as described favour a cardioembolic aetiology whereas the bilateral internal border zone acute infarcts suggest a hypoperfusion aetiology.

      "Differential diagnosis\n",

      "This was a case of severe biventricular failure with biventricular thrombi of uncertain aetiology. A number of differential diagnoses were considered.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, a stress-induced or ‘Takotsubo’ cardiomyopathy was felt to be less likely in this case given an absence of a preceding emotional or physical stressor, although these stressors may not be present in up to one-third of patients with Takotsubo syndrome.5 The insidious onset, over months prior to admission, was also not typical for Takotsubo syndrome, which classically presents more acutely and left ventricular function often recovers more quickly (usually within 21 days of onset).6 Furthermore, our patient did not fulfil the revised Mayo Clinic criteria7 or the international Takotsubo diagnostic criteria,8 and transthoracic echocardiography did not show any of the characteristic features (transient hypokinesis, akinesis or dyskinesis of the left ventricular mid-segments with or without apical involvement or any regional wall motion abnormalities extending beyond a single epicardial vascular distribution).9 Finally, Takotsubo syndrome predominantly affects postmenopausal women, although there have been case reports of younger male patients.10\n",
      "\n",
      "Heart failure secondary to myocarditis was also considered, however again the insidious clinical course was not typical for acute fulminant myocarditis and the CMR scan did not show the typical myocardial inflammation or fibrosis associated with this condition. Heart failure secondary to metabolic disturbances resulting from chronic renal failure was also considered as a potential differential diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "A tachycardia-related cardiomyopathy was excluded as there was no evidence of arrhythmia throughout the admission, during which the patient remained on cardiac monitoring. Given the history of chronic energy drink consumption, lack of significant past medical or family history, cardiac imaging findings and improvement with ceasing intake, energy drink-induced cardiotoxicity was felt to be the most likely cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment\n",
      "\n",
      "Initial medical treatment was with intravenous furosemide and antibiotics for a suspected community acquired pneumonia. The patient was anticoagulated with unfractionated heparin, later switched to argatroban and then warfarin due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bilateral nephrostomies were inserted 3 days after admission, with little subsequent improvement in renal function. He later required temporary haemodialysis and now remains a low clearance patient under renal and urology follow-up with bilateral nephrostomies and ureteric stents.\n",
      "\n",
      "After stabilisation he was discharged on the following medications: warfarin once daily, carvedilol 3.125 mg twice daily, furosemide 20 mg once daily, isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg twice daily, hydralazine 25 mg three times a day, lansoprazole and oral nutritional supplements. Persisting severe renal impairment prevented the introduction of ACE inhibitor or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Outcome and follow-up\n",
      "\n",
      "Post discharge, the patient had a considerable increase in exercise tolerance without any symptoms of heart failure or palpitations (NYHA class I). The patient had maintained euvolaemia and haemodynamic stability. Renal function remained severely impaired (estimated glomerular filtration rate 18 mL/min), and we were able to uptitrate carvedilol to 6.25 mg twice daily during the follow-up period in addition to his other medications. At 9 months post-discharge, a repeat echocardiogram showed that the left ventricular size had normalised with mildly impaired systolic function (LVEF 51%). There was no evidence of the previous intracardiac thrombus.\n",
      "\n",
      "As mentioned previously, poor renal function has largely inhibited the use of best medical therapy for heart failure. However, despite this, the patient has continued to improve and recover ventricular function. This is likely to be due to avoidance of energy drinks. He is no longer under follow-up from the cardiac transplantation team due to his improvement. However, it is difficult to predict the clinical course of recovery or potential for relapse. It is likely that the patient will at some point require renal transplantation. He has undergone urodynamic studies and bladder biopsies, which have not conclusively identified the cause of obstructive uropathy but do indicate that future bladder reconstruction is likely to be required to protect a future renal graft.\n",

      "This was a male patient, who presented with ascending aortic dissection, and who, even after surgery for dissection repair, developed a picture of severe heart failure and died.\n",
      "\n",
      "The International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD) showed that patients with aortic dissection were older than our patient, 61 years; and a majority of males (63%). Regarding the diseases related to the dissection, they were: Marfan syndrome (6.7%), hypertension (69.3%), atherosclerosis (24.4%), previously known aortic aneurysm (12.4%), previous aortic dissection 3.9%) and diabetes mellitus (4.3%). Also, 15.9% had a history of previous cardiac surgery and iatrogenic cause in 4.8% (1.7% coronary angiography and 3.1% after cardiac surgery). The 2015 update of the same registry, with a ten-fold higher number of patients, showed an increase in hypertension (75.5%) and a decrease in the presence of Marfan syndrome (4.5%), (75.5%), atherosclerosis (19.6%) and previous cardiac surgery (10.6%).\n",
      "\n",
      "Genetic tests can be performed in the presence of aortic aneurysm in younger patients. The syndromes related to the presence of aortic aneurysms are Marfan, Loeys-Dietz, Ehler-Danlos syndromes, the cutis laxa or elastolysis and that related to a defect in the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ).\n",
      "\n",
      "Classically, the genetic alterations found in Marfan syndrome are related to the fibrillin-1 gene. Changes in the physical examination involve ocular (myopia, ectopia lentis, and risk of retinal detachment), skeletal (exaggerated growth and joint laxity, exaggerated growth of the extremities) and cardiovascular alterations (dilation of the aorta at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva, predisposing to dissection). In the present case, we do not have a description of these phenotypic changes that might suggest such diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Loeys-Dietz syndrome includes several manifestations similar to those of Marfan Syndrome, but they also include hypertelorism, broad or bifid uvula, cleft palate and generalized arterial tortuosity, aneurysms, and arterial dissection. Generally no increase of extremities and ocular alterations are observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "As well as for Marfan syndrome, we do not have evidence in the present case to suggest such a diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ehler-Danlos syndrome is characterized by fragility of the connective tissue and the manifestations occur in the skin (hyperelasticity, atrophic scars and easy ecchymosis), joints (hypermotility, frequent dislocations and arthralgias) and vessels (aneurysms and spontaneous vessel ruptures). The vascular form, in which dissection occurs most frequently, occurs through a mutation in the alpha-1 gene of type III collagen, with a silent substitution that leads to the replacement of glycine in the collagen chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also have no clinical evidence of such changes in the present case. A more recent study showed gene panel alterations in 25% of patients with aortic aneurysms.\n",
      "\n",
      "What should be taken into account is that even today the criterion for the indication of surgical treatment for rupture prevention remains the diameter of the aneurysm, 50 mm.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the present case, the patient had arterial hypertension and it must have had an important role in the development of the thoracic aneurysm and its rupture. Biomechanical studies show that for hypertension to lead an aneurysm development, there must be concomitant failure in the composition and maintenance of the extracellular matrix and membrane receptors. Consequently, there is damage to the mechanical stress transduction in the cell-signaling response.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the patient’s unfavorable evolution after the surgery, it is probably due to the long evolution of the aortic aneurysm with aortic valve regurgitation, leading to left ventricular dilation and severe dysfunction, which in the very late states do not undergo regression or relief despite valve replacement surgery and progress to progressive heart failure. The ECG disclosed left ventricular overload with strain and the echocardiogram showed large left ventricular dilation and marked dysfunction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The European Guidelines of Cardiology and Thoracic Surgery recommends valve replacement surgery in patients with aortic dilation or aortic regurgitation accentuated with symptoms. In asymptomatic patients, this recommendation appears if there is reduction in ejection fraction (<50%) or ventricular dilation (diastolic diameter >70 mm or diastolic >50 mm).\n",
      "\n",

A corrugated tube replaced the ascending aorta and was sutured just above the aortic sinotubular junction. Around the junction area between the ascending aorta and the ventricular mass, we noticed cavitation with irregular margins, partially filled by liquefied material, of a yellowish-brown color.

      "His brother states that he has been getting steadily worse, with multiple near falls and unsteadiness in 2 days leading up to admission. He has never had any symptoms like this before, and has poor insight into his symptoms. His behaviour and mental status have also been inappropriate, as the brother states he has been unable to complete activities of daily living such as bathing or feeding himself. His affect has also been more flat than normal, with the patient’s brother reporting significantly longer time to respond to questions than his baseline. He also reported one episode of hyper elation and agitation that resolved after several hours. He has been alert and oriented to only person and place, but not time (normally he is fully oriented). The patient denies any shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, headache, vomiting, diarrhoea or decreased oral intake. He and his brother deny any trauma.

His medication regimen is notable for spironolactone 25 mg daily, torsemide 200 mg two times per day and metolazone 2.5 mg daily for diuresis. This large dose of diuretics was due to a recent hospitalisation for congestive heart failure exacerbation with volume overload. It was during this hospitalisation that torsemide was increased, and spironolactone was added with metolazone. His other home medications included atorvastatin 80 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily, hydroxyzine 25 mg as needed for itching, mirtazapine 30 mg daily, olanzapine 10 mg daily, trazodone 50 mg as needed for sleep, metoclopramide 5 mg as needed for nausea and pantoprazole 40 mg two times per day for heartburn.

      "\n",
      "Given his significant electrolyte abnormalities, prerenal azotemia, extensive and recently advanced home diuretic regimen and hypovolemic physical examination, the patient was assessed to be in severe hypotonic hyponatremia due to hypovolemia from over-diuresis as the cause of his presenting symptoms. In concordance with cardiology consultation, he was treated with gradual sodium correction with isotonic fluids. Normal saline was introduced at 100 mL/hour, with sodium checks in every 4 hours to avoid correction greater than 8–10 mmol/L in 24 hours. His home diuretics were held while correcting sodium. We also held his other home medications, including his schizophrenia medication olanzapine due to the risk of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), which may worsen his hyponatremia. In addition, with the patient’s hypokalemia requiring aggressive repletion, we were concerned with continuing his olanzapine and its inherent risk of QT-interval prolongation. His electrolytes improved on this therapy, with a peak in sodium to 119 mmol/L on the morning of hospital day 4. However, by that afternoon, his sodium actually decreased to 116 mmol/L. At this point, his potassium and chloride had corrected, and his creatinine returned close to baseline. His presenting symptoms of ataxia, altered mental status and fatigue had slightly improved. He was able to walk around the room with supervision and had no falls. He was awake throughout the day and did not report fatigue. However, given that he was a poor historian with a very flat affect secondary to his schizophrenia history, it was difficult to ascertain his insight into his symptoms. It was also difficult to tell if his negative symptoms had worsened while holding olanzapine, but his brother confirmed that he was around his baseline in this regard. While he was oriented to person, place and time, his lack of insight and inability to describe his concerns remained a challenge throughout the hospitalisation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following his initial presentation and volume repletion, his physical examination, symptoms, labs and imaging supported an euvolemic aetiology of his hyponatremia. He remained clear on pulmonary auscultation and did not have any abdominal distention, jugular venous distention or lower extremity oedema. He also did not report any cough, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. His BNP had decreased to 1837 pg/mL. A chest radiograph showed right basilar atelectasis with possible infiltrate, but was mostly stable compared with baseline. In conjunction with an euvolemic hyponatremia, an evaluation for SIADH was started. This was not only supported by his current examination status, but he was also being treated with olanzapine prior to admission, which has a risk for SIADH. His intravenous fluids were stopped and he was placed on a 1000 mL/day fluid restriction. However, his hyponatremia failed to significantly improve with a value of 117 mmol/L on the morning of hospital day 5, and 118 mmol/L on the morning of day 6. His urine electrolytes included a urine sodium of less than 20 mmol/L, urine potassium 26.9 mmol/L, urine chloride 23 mmol/L and urine osmolality 315 mOsm/kg H2O. His low urine sodium suggested that SIADH was not the aetiology of his hyponatremia. He remained clinically euvolemic on physical examination on hospital day 6, including normal pulmonary examination to auscultation, no jugular venous distention, no oedema, normal capillary refill and no abdominal distention. He also did not report cough, orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, and continued to state that he had been resting comfortably every night.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the setting of likely mismanagement of this patient’s hyponatremia, the primary inpatient teaching service used point-of-care ultrasound on the morning of hospital day 6 to better assess the patient’s volume status. The patient was found to have a moderate-sized right pleural effusion and diffuse pulmonary parenchymal B-lines suggesting pulmonary oedema. His inferior vena cava appeared plethoric and its diameter measured 2.5 cm with no respiratory variation. His estimated Caval Index was 1, given this lack of respiratory change, which is significantly higher than the estimated 0.35 in euvolemic patients.2 In all, the ultrasound findings supported hypervolemia. As a result, a diuretic regimen was started with oral torsemide 60 mg two times per day and his volume response and sodium were monitored closely. His sodium improved to 126 mmol/L on hospital day 7, and then he was successfully discharged home with a sodium of 132 mmol/L on hospital day 8. He was stable at time of discharge, with discharge summary stating to monitor volume status closely in upcoming appointments. He was also counselled on medication adherence, frequent weight monitoring and fluid restriction. Home health services were called prior to his discharge to discuss assisting his mother and brother with his care.\n",

      "While the internal medicine teaching service and the cardiology service recommended discharge to skilled nursing facility to help manage his medications and chronic debility, he wanted to be discharged home to his mother and brother. He followed up with his cardiologist 2 weeks after discharge, and was scheduled with his primary care physician but never arrived at that appointment. At the time of his cardiology follow-up, his diuretic regimen was torsemide 100 mg two times per day (down from 200 mg two times per day), spironolactone 25 mg daily (same as prior to hospitalisation) and metolazone 2.5 mg daily (same as prior to hospitalisation). In setting of his heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, he was started on 25 mg daily of metoprolol succinate. He had also resumed his home medications that were held during the hospitalisation, most notably olanzapine 10 mg daily and mirtazapine 30 mg daily for his schizophrenia. He had no complaints of fatigue, altered mental status, ataxia or abnormal behaviour. His sodium at this visit was 130 mmol/L, somewhat stable since discharge. Medication non-adherence remained an issue at follow-up, with patient having little understanding of his medical history or current medications.

      "A 50-year-old man presented to his primary care provider with a 2-week history of progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion and chest discomfort while in the flat position. He described his dyspnea as a feeling of “breathing through a straw.” Additional symptoms included a weight gain of 5 kg in the prior 3 weeks, increased abdominal girth, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He also noticed a decline in exercise tolerance from a prior ability to ascend 9 flights of stairs to tolerating only a few steps. He denied fevers, chills, night sweats, palpitations, lightheadedness, or dizziness. He had no recent upper respiratory illness symptoms, such as nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, or sinus pain. His medical history was notable for a small, congenital ventricular septal defect (VSD), obesity (body mass index, 35 kg/m2) and seasonal allergies. His only medication included fexofenadine. He never used tobacco products and reported an average alcohol intake of 2 to 3 beverages per week. In terms of family history, he has a brother with a history of atrial fibrillation; otherwise, there was no family medical history of heart failure or premature coronary artery disease. On physical examination, he was tachycardic with a heart rate of 148 beats per minute with an irregularly irregular rhythm, bibasilar crackles, abdominal distention, jugular venous distension, hepatojugular reflux, and 1+, symmetric, bilateral lower extremity pitting edema.\n",

Patients with volume overload secondary to CHF often demonstrate dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He also has physical examination findings of bibasilar crackles, pitting edema, and abdominal distension. The progressive nature of dyspnea is less consistent with pulmonary embolus or an acute coronary syndrome. Although constrictive pericarditis can manifest with jugular venous distension and chest discomfort in the flat position, he does not have pleuritic chest pain, fever, or a friction rub on physical examination.\n",

      "Right heart catheterization would provide additional hemodynamic information including cardiac output, filling pressures, and central venous pressure; however, it is not routinely indicated in new diagnosis of heart failure. A TTE is a first-line diagnostic test in new cases of heart failure to assess for left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and structural changes, such as wall motion abnormalities or ventricular dilatation or hypertrophy. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can be used to evaluate assess wall motion abnormalities, function, and myocardial tissue perfusion, injury, infiltration, fibrosis, and viability, but is not an appropriate initial test. Endomyocardial biopsies are reserved for patients with progressively worsening heart failure despite appropriate medical therapy, for whom amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, or giant-cell myocarditis is suspected. Coronary angiogram can be considered in new diagnoses of heart failure to determine whether there is an ischemic etiology or reversible ischemia, especially in patients with risk factors. However, angiography would not be the first diagnostic test.\n",

There was no change in his congenital VSD. At the time of the study, he was notably tachycardic (132 bpm). An ECG 1 year ago showed an LVEF of 60%, no regional wall motion abnormalities, normal right ventricular size and systolic function, small membranous VSD with restrictive left-to-right shunt, mild tricuspid regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation, trivial aortic stenosis, and trivial aortic regurgitation.\n",

      "His clinical symptomatology of CHF and LVEF less than 50% classifies the diagnosis of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).\n",
      "\n",
      "Along with a TTE, initial diagnostic evaluation for acute CHF presentations should include a 12-lead ECG to evaluate for acute myocardial infarction, tachyarrhythmia, conduction abnormalities, or left ventricular hypertrophy. A chest radiography should be obtained to evaluate for an acute cardiopulmonary process such as pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. Other initial laboratory studies should include a complete blood cell count (CBC) with differential, electrolyte levels, creatinine, N-terminal-pro b-type natriuretic peptide, troponin level, urinalysis, lipid panel and TSH. Coronary artery disease causes approximately two thirds of CHF, and an acute coronary syndrome should be suggested as a cause of new-onset heart failure if there are elevated troponin levels, new ECG abnormalities, an acute onset of symptoms, or concurrent signs and symptoms of systemic hypoperfusion.1 Hyponatremia, if present, is a poor prognostic factor.2\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient also had an ECG Holter monitor revealing of atrial fibrillation with heart rates varying from 93–179 bpm (average, 126 bpm) with RVR occurring 99.9% of the time captured. He reported dyspnea while in atrial fibrillation with RVR. He was given furosemide and metoprolol tartrate by his primary care physician with plans to titrate to heart rates slower than 110 bpm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three beta blockers with beta-1 activity have been shown to decrease mortality in heart failure: carvedilol, bisoprolol, and metoprolol succinate. A switch to atenolol would not be appropriate. There is some debate as to whether carvedilol is superior to metoprolol in mortality reduction, as shown by the COMET trial in 2003.3 In this study, carvedilol had better reduction in mortality rate compared with metoprolol tartrate. Carvedilol has alpha blockade properties that is speculated to be beneficial by facilitating vasodilation, glucose uptake, and insulin sensitivity. Of note, because the COMET trial used the tartrate formulation instead of the extended-release succinate form, a definite superiority between metoprolol succinate and carvedilol cannot be determined. Beta blocker dose response relationship to reduction in mortality has been shown; patients should be uptitrated on beta blockers as tolerated in HFrEF and until rate control is achieved in atrial fibrillation. Furosemide is a more appropriate diuretic than hydrochlorothiazide. Dosing should be based on volume status; however, there is no dose-dependent relationship to mortality outcomes. ICD placement consideration is indicated for primary prophylaxis against sudden cardiac death in patients with New York Heart Association Class II or III HFrEF with LVEF less than 35% after 3 months of optimal medical management. However, patients should be on optimal medical treatment and treated for reversible underlying etiologies before ICD implantation consideration. Similarly, mitral valve replacement is not indicated at this time, as his severe mitral regurgitation is functional and could improve with treatment of reversible causes. The 2014 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Rhythm Society recommends long-term anticoagulation based on thromboembolic risk as determined by the CHA2DS2-VASC Score. This patient began taking long-term apixaban considering his moderate risk stratification (CHA2DS2-VASC score of 1 for heart failure, or 0.6% stroke per year risk), low LVEF with ventricular dilatation, and low bleeding risk. He transitioned to carvedilol for beta blockade, started taking lisinopril, and continued with furosemide as directed by his cardiologist.\n",
      "\n",
      "His HFrEF was thought to be most likely due to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Initial clues were new reduced LVEF with generalized hypokinesis in the setting of a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation with predominant RVR on ECG Holter monitoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a return visit to his primary care physician, the patient had persistently elevated heart rates to the 130-bpm range despite being uptitrated on carvedilol therapy. His in-clinic blood pressure was 104/81 mm Hg.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy results from prolonged elevated heart rate, which is often reversible upon control of the arrhythmia or heart rate. The goal of initial therapy is to achieve rate control. Increasing beta blockade would be an option for achieving rate control in this patient. However, rate control may be difficult to achieve with beta blockade in patients with rapid ventricular rates and new reduction of ejection fraction (EF)das in this case. Therefore, early electrical cardioversion is warranted to reduce the risk of further progression of HFrEF. Pacemaker placement is not indicated. ICD referral may be warranted at a later time, if left ventricular systolic function does not recover after appropriate medical therapy. Aspirin and clopidogrel are not indicated in heart failure or atrial fibrillation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of this patient’s markedly depressed EF, a TEE-guided direct cardioversion was pursued urgently; it was successful after the third synchronous shock of 100, 120, and 150 J. The TEE also showed severe left atrial enlargement, along with previously seen severe mitral regurgitation and severe tricuspid regurgitation. An ECG after cardioversion showed sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 94 bpm with premature atrial complexes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although direct electric cardioversion is an effective way to revert to sinus rhythm, there is a high rate of atrial fibrillation recurrence, with as few as 23% of patients remaining in sinus rhythm after 1 year. Risk factors for reverting back to arrhythmia included duration of arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation (vs atrial flutter), and age. The patient was started on amiodarone after his cardioversion because of his severe left atrial enlargement and concern for early relapse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amiodarone can cause adverse effects of long-term use, including pulmonary toxicity, thyroid dysfunction, hepatotoxicity. The risks and benefits of continuing the drug should be discussed with the patient. Baseline tests include chest radiography, pulmonary function tests, thyroid function tests, and transaminases. Hematologic, renal, and cardiac toxicities are uncommon; thus, CBC/peripheral smear/lactic acid dehydrogenase, sodium/potassium/creatinine, ECG Holter and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and cardiac catheterization are not routine studies before starting amiodarone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Repeated TTE 2 months later showed a significantly improved EF of 52%, with mildemoderate left ventricular enlargement, mild generalized hypokinesis, and borderline right ventricular enlargement with borderline decreased systolic function and estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 32 mm Hg. The degree of mitral regurgitation had improved to mildemoderate severity and tricuspid regurgitation was trivial. The patient had a weight loss of 15 kg while taking furosemide and overall symptomatic improvement with increased exercise capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four months later, a repeated TTE revealed a decline in EF to 35%−40 %, with substantial beat-to-beat variability, return of atrial fibrillation with RVR, moderate left ventricular hypokinesis, borderline decrease in right ventricular systolic function, and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation. His heart rate was 111 bpm. He underwent repeat direct current cardioversion. Follow-up TTE 2 months after repeated direct current cardioversion showed improvement of his EF again to 61% without regional wall motion abnormalities and a mildly enlarged left ventricle. Long-term therapy with amiodarone was discussed with this patient, but not pursued because of potential adverse effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation, and subsequent reduced EF with each of these episodes, the decision was made to pursue a rhythm control strategy, and the patient underwent atrial fibrillation ablative therapy. He remained asymptomatic 6 months later, with no recurrent episodes, and maintained his left ventricular systolic function (EF = 61%).\n",

      "Clinical findings\n",
      "During the physical examination of Ms. Emily Turner, several pertinent findings emerged, shedding light on the cardiovascular sequelae of her hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cardiovascular examination\n",
      "\n",
      "Elevated heart rate. A palpable and sustained tachycardia was noted, with a resting heart rate exceeding 100 beats per minute. This high heart rate was consistent with the hyperthyroid state, reflecting the direct impact of excess thyroid hormones on cardiac contractility and heart rate regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Irregular rhythms. Auscultation revealed intermittent irregular heartbeats, suggesting arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. The presence of these arrhythmias further emphasized the cardiac repercussions of thyrotoxicosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Murmurs and gallops. A systolic murmur was audible over the mitral area, possibly indicative of increased flow across the mitral valve due to hyperdynamic circulation. A third heart sound (S3 gallop) was auscultated, suggesting impaired left ventricular function.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peripheral edema. Mild peripheral edema was detected, hinting at potential fluid retention secondary to impaired cardiac function. This finding supported the possibility of heart failure due to thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Endocrine and general examination\n",
      "\n",
      "Thyroid enlargement. Physical examination of the thyroid gland revealed diffuse enlargement, consistent with a goiter, corroborating the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fine tremor. A fine tremor was observed in the patient’s outstretched hands, a classic neurological manifestation of hyperthyroidism that underscores the systemic impact of thyroid hormone excess.\n",
      "\n",
      "Psychosocial evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "Anxiety and restlessness. The patient exhibited signs of restlessness and anxiety, which could be attributed to the direct influence of excess thyroid hormones on the central nervous system.\n",
      "These clinical findings collectively portrayed a complex interplay between thyroid dysfunction and cardiovascular alterations. The physical examination underscored the remarkable influence of hyperthyroidism on cardiac function, evident through the elevated heart rate, arrhythmias, murmurs, and signs of heart failure. These findings informed the subsequent diagnostic and therapeutic interventions to manage Ms. Turner thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy.\n",

      "Timeline depicting the crucial milestones related to the diagnosis and interventions for Ms. Emily Turner thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy\n",
      "\n",
      "Month 1:\n",
      "Ms. Turner presents with palpitations, weight loss, and anxiety. Physical examination reveals elevated heart rate, irregular rhythms, and mild peripheral edema.\n",
      "Initial thyroid function tests show significantly elevated levels of free thyroxine (T4) and suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), confirming hyperthyroidism.\n",
      "Cardiovascular imaging (echocardiogram) reveals impaired left ventricular function and signs of heart failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Month 2:\n",
      "Ms. Turner genetic testing results indicate specific genetic markers associated with thyroid dysfunction and autoimmune disorders.\n",

      "Diagnostic assessments\n",
      "\n",
      "Diagnostic methods\n",
      "The diagnostic assessment for Ms. Emily Turner thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy involved a multidimensional approach encompassing various methods:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Physical examination\n",
      "The physical examination revealed elevated heart rate, irregular heart rhythms, peripheral edema, and thyroid enlargement. These findings provided crucial clues to the underlying cardiovascular and endocrine abnormalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Laboratory testing\n",
      "Thyroid function tests played a pivotal role in confirming the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. Elevated free thyroxine (T4) levels and suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were consistent with this disorder. Genetic testing was also performed to assess hereditary predisposition to thyroid dysfunction and autoimmune conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cardiovascular imaging\n",
      "Echocardiography was employed to visualize the heart structure and function. The echocardiogram revealed impaired left ventricular function and signs of heart failure, thereby indicating the presence of thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy.\n",

      "Effective communication and understanding of Ms. Turner symptoms and medical history could have been influenced by language barriers and cultural nuances.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Diagnostic reasoning\n",
      "In Ms. Turner case, the primary diagnosis of thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy was reached through careful diagnostic reasoning:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinical presentation\n",
      "The combination of palpitations, weight loss, anxiety, and elevated heart rate initially indicated hyperthyroidism.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thyroid function tests\n",
      "Elevated free T4 and suppressed TSH levels were consistent with hyperthyroidism. However, the cardiac manifestations indicated the presence of thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy as the underlying complication.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Echocardiography\n",
      "The echocardiogram confirmed impaired cardiac function, linking the hyperthyroidism to cardiomyopathy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Prognostic characteristics\n",
      "In thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy, prognostic assessment revolves around cardiac function and the response to treatment. As Ms. Turner cardiac function improved throughout treatment, evidenced by echocardiographic findings, her prognosis became more favorable. Typically used in oncology, staging does not directly apply to thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy; cardiac function parameters serve as prognostic indicators, guiding treatment response evaluation and long-term outcome predictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Therapeutic Interventions\n",
      "The management of Ms. Emily Turner thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy involved a comprehensive and multifaceted approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Pharmacologic interventions:\n",
      "Antithyroid Medications: Mys. Turner was prescribed methimazole, an antithyroid medication, to inhibit excessive thyroid hormone production—this pharmacologic intervention aimed to normalize thyroid hormone levels and mitigate their impact on cardiovascular function.\n",
      "Beta-Blockers: To control her elevated heart rate and manage arrhythmias, Ms. Turner was administered beta-blockers. These medications reduce heart rate, decrease cardiac workload, and enhance cardiac stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Self-care strategies\n",
      "Lifestyle Modifications: Ms. Turner was advised to adopt stress-reduction techniques, prioritize adequate sleep, and maintain a balanced diet to support her overall health and recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Administration of intervention\n",
      "Antithyroid Medications (Methimazole): Initiated at 10 mg daily, Ms. Turner dosage was adjusted based on regular thyroid function tests. Dosage titration aimed to achieve normal thyroid hormone levels while minimizing the risk of hypothyroidism.\n",
      "Beta-Blockers: Ms. Turner was prescribed propranolol at 40 mg twice daily. The dosage was tailored to her heart rate and individual response to achieve heart rate control and symptom relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "Changes in intervention\n",
      "\n",
      "Dosage adjustment of antithyroid medications. As Ms. Turner thyroid hormone levels normalized, her methimazole dosage was gradually reduced. This adjustment aimed to prevent overtreatment while maintaining thyroid function within the normal range.\n",
      "\n",
      "Modification of beta-blocker dosage. As Ms. Turner heart rate stabilized within a healthy range and arrhythmias diminished, the propranolol dosage was tapered down. This reflected her improved cardiac function and reduced need for heart rate control.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rationale for changes\n",
      "\n",
      "Dosage adjustment of antithyroid medications. Reducing the methimazole dosage prevented the risk of inducing hypothyroidism, a common side effect of excessive treatment. This step ensured that Ms. Turner thyroid function was restored to a balanced state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Modification of beta-blocker dosage. As her cardiac function improved and her heart rate stabilized, lowering the propranolol dosage reflected the positive response to treatment. The gradual reduction of medication aimed to maintain her heart rate within a physiological range without unnecessary drug exposure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Follow-up and outcomes. Ms. Emily Turner follow-up encompassed regular assessments to monitor her progress:\n",
      "\n",
      "Clinician-assessed outcomes\n",
      "Cardiac Function Improvement: Subsequent echocardiograms revealed progressive improvement in left ventricular function and resolution of heart failure signs.\n",
      "Heart Rate Control: Ms. Turner heart rate stabilized within the normal range, with arrhythmias becoming infrequent.\n",
      "Normalization of Thyroid Function: Thyroid function tests consistently showed free T4 and TSH levels within the normal range, indicating successful management of hyperthyroidism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patient-assessed outcomes\n",
      "Symptom Relief: Ms. Turner reported reduced palpitations, anxiety, and fatigue, contributing to an enhanced quality of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Significant follow-up test result\n",

      "Thyroid function tests. Regular thyroid function tests confirmed the sustained normalization of thyroid hormone levels, confirming the effectiveness of antithyroid medications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Echocardiograms. Serial echocardiograms demonstrated the progressive improvement of left ventricular function, validating the efficacy of the treatment approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intervention adherence and tolerability. Intervention adherence and tolerability were assessed through:\n",
      "Patient Self-Reports: Ms. Turner provided feedback on her adherence to medication regimens and any observed side effects.\n",
      "Clinical Consultations: Regular clinical check-ins allowed clinicians to inquire about any difficulties or concerns related to medication adherence and tolerability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adverse and unanticipated events\n",
      "\n",
      "Adverse events. Ms. Turner reported mild gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea and upset stomach, attributed to the antithyroid medication. These symptoms were managed through dose adjustments and supportive measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unanticipated event. Ms. Turner experienced brief palpitations and shortness of breath during the follow-up. This unanticipated event prompted additional cardiac assessments, which revealed no significant changes. The event was attributed to a temporary increase in stress and resolved spontaneously.\n",

Neck veins were engorged. Her pulse was 110 bpm, regular; blood pressure 90/40 mm Hg, respiratory rate 30 per minute. All the heart sounds were soft, decreased in intensity, with audible S3 gallops. Chest auscultation revealed bibasilar extensive rales extending more than 10 cm above the diaphragm at the posterior scapular lines. There was soft, tender hepatomegaly with positive hepatojugular reflux. Dermatological examinations revealed the presence of heliotrope rash around eyelids characterised by periorbital, confluent and erythema; poikilodermatous changes consisting of erythema, altered pigmentation and telangiectasias were seen over the photo-exposed skin, that is extensor surfaces of the upper arm; the upper chest, in a ‘V-neck’ configuration; the upper back (shawl sign) and the lateral thighs (holster sign). On examination of hands, hyperkeratotic lesions were predominantly seen involving the centre of palms (mechanics hands) along with the presence of Gottron’s papules on proximal interphalangeal joints. Detailed neurological examination could not be done at that time as to manage the cardiac emergency was more important at that time.\n",

      "On the first day of admission, reports of complete blood count with differentials, iron studies, blood sugar, renal, liver, thyroid function tests, lipid profile, viral serology were normal except mild normocytic normochromic anaemia of chronic disease (10.8 g/dL, n>12.5; haematocrit 33%, n = 37–47; total iron-binding capacity 220 µg/dL, n = 250–450; serum iron 50 µg/dL, n = 40–180; ferritin 800 ng/mL, n = 10–291) and disproportionately increased level of aspartate amino transferase (370 U/L, n = 10–35) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (90 mg/dL, n<6). ECG showed sinus tachycardia with non-specific ST-T changes. Echocardiography revealed global hypokinesia with normal chamber dimensions, EPSS of 16 mm with severely reduced LVEF of 25%, grade 3 LVDD and TAPSE of 16 mm. NT pro-BNP was 4500 pg/mL (n<115), and Troponin-T kit test was strongly positive. She had normal coronaries on angiography. Thus, she was diagnosed as a case of biventricular HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) due to non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy.\n",
      "\n",
      "To confirm the diagnosis of DM and to search for any underlying malignancy, various directed investigation modalities were adopted thereafter. Serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) (7840 IU/L n<145), lactate dehydrogenase (560 U/L, n<10) and aldolase (78 U/L, n<6.0) levels were very high. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) (hep2) was strongly positive (36.40 U/mL, n≤10) and ANA profile exhibited strongly positive (3+) anti-Mi-2 antibodies. Antitranscription intermediary factor (TIF)-gamma antibody test was positive. MRI of clinically involved muscle groups displayed hyperintense signal in T2 throughout the affected muscles. Axial short-T1 inversion recovery (STIR) images showed diffuse hyperintensity suggestive of perimuscular oedema in all the thigh muscles particularly in hamstrings with involvement of subcutaneous tissue septa and skin thickening which were highly characteristics of DM. Muscle biopsy showed features of skeletal muscle with perifascicular atrophy, mild perivascular chronic non-specific inflammatory cell infiltrate and mature adipose tissue infiltration consistent with DM.\n",

Cancer markers such as cancer antigen (CA)-125, CA 19-9, carcinoembryonic antigen were negative. Only the Pap smear of cervix showed high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Four weeks after diagnosis, she was transferred to department of gynaecology for total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TAH-BSO). The tissue biopsy obtained from hysterectomy showed well-differentiated SCC with faintly positive E-cadherin (suggesting good prognosis) and weakly positive vimentin (indicative of stunning differentiation) of TNM stage T1a1 N0 M0.\n",

      "Initially on admission, she had a working diagnosis of biventricular failure and course of evolution of symptoms and signs clearly suggested so. Echocardiographic findings and high level of NT-proBNP further attested the diagnosis of HFrEF. High levels of cardiac biomarkers, non-specific ST-T changes with central chest discomfort and signs of HF made us to rule out coexisting coronary artery disease (CAD) by coronary angiography. Ruling out CAD as a cause of HF also opened the avenue for myocarditis as a differential diagnosis. Serial echocardiography showed improvement in contractility of the myocardium and thereby increase in stroke volume, ejection fraction and amelioration of failure symptoms. We could not do a cardiac MRI and endomyocardial biopsy because of our poor resource set-up. Still, clinical course of the ailment, hectic rise in levels of cardiac enzymes in absence of myocardial infarction, outcome and most importantly coexistence of an autoimmune disease supported the diagnosis of myocarditis.8\n",

      "In a backdrop of subacute onset progressive bilateral symmetrical proximal muscle weakness with classic dermatological signs, the diagnosis was quite evident. High CPK levels, positive autoantibodies, classical muscle MRI and Electromyography (EMG) findings muscles followed by muscle biopsy sealed the diagnosis of definite DM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Careful medical history and physical examination of the patients (including gynaecological examination), taking into account the patient’s age and other risk factors, were carried out. Since this patient was at high risk (elderly at the time of onset and the presence of severe disease of the skin), symptoms of severe myopathy, significantly elevated markers of inflammation and positive for anti-TIF-1 gamma antibody, more advanced screening was considered. CECT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, mammography, ultrasound of breasts, abdomen and pelvis, tumour markers, Pap smear and biopsy from cervix were opted for. This revealed the diagnosis of carcinoma of cervix.\n",

      "Management of HF: Initially the crisis was managed by moist oxygen, intravenous loop diuretics (intravenous furosemide 40 mg stat, followed by intravenous torsemide 20 mg every 6 hours), inotrops (dobutamine 10 μg/kg/min continuous intravenous infusion) and cardiac remodelling inhibitors (eplerenone 25 mg/day and ramipril 1.25 mg/day). Dobutamine infusion was gradually tapered off as LVEF and blood pressure improved over the course. After 3 days, carvedilol 6.25 mg/day was added. Ramipril was changed to valsartan/sacubitril (100 mg/day) thereafter.\n",
      "Management of DM: After stamping the diagnosis of DM on seventh day postadmission, she was put on intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g/day in 100 mL normal saline over 1 hour for 5 days) followed by oral prednisolone (50 mg/day). Along with that oral methotrexate (15 mg once per week) and azathioprine (100 mg/day) were added to her regimen. Daily physiotherapy was initiated.\n",

      "Cardiological outcome: Patient became haemodynamically stable within 3 days postadmission and by a week she was symptom free along with favourably down-going levels of cardiac biomarkers. None of antifailure medications needed to be continued except low-dose valsartan/sacubitril 100 mg/day during discharge. During discharge (nearly after 3 months of stay in hospital), she was free from clinical signs and symptoms of HF (New York Heart Association grade 1). Echocardiography showed only grade 1 LVDD (LVEF 65%). At discharge NT-proBNP was 180 pg/mL. After 1 month of follow-up postdischarge, echocardiography was completely normal.\n",
      "Rheumatological and neurological outcome: She did not initially respond well to therapy with steroids, methotrexate and azathioprine; at least for the first one and a half months, muscle weakness did not abate at all, though pain ameliorated. Skin manifestations were abolished by the end of third week after commencement of immune-suppressive therapy. At sixth week, she started showing some improvement of her proximal muscle power and this was more pronounced in upper extremities. Up to 12th week, the improvement speed was maintaining a plateau. Within 13th week, she started showing fast improvement in her hamstrings power. She started her activities of daily living without much help from others. She was discharged with prednisolone 20 mg/day, azathioprine 100 mg/day, calcium +vitamin D3 once per day, methotrexate 10 mg/week. Inflammatory markers and muscle strength got normalised in 4 months.\n",
      "Gynaec-oncological outcome: Urge urinary incontinence developed postoperatively, which was managed conservatively with Kegel’s exercises. Periodic follow-up did not show any residual tumour activity.\n",
